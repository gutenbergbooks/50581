<h2>TO MONS<sup>R.</sup> LEON FAUCHER.</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I have fulfilled the promise I made you a few
weeks since, by translating, I hope intelligibly,
your remarks on the subject of the Production, &amp;c.,
of the Precious Metals, which I read first in the
August number of the “<i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>,”
and which have been subsequently published, somewhat
amplified, in the reports of the “<i>Académie des
Sciences Morales et Politiques</i>.” Since the date of
your remarks, the production of gold in Australia
has been greater than you anticipated; recent
reports estimate the amount shipped, or ready for
shipment, from thence, at not less than £8,000,000
sterling; at which figure, I think, we may safely
place the produce of 1852.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span></p>

<p>A gentleman who was with me a few days since,
just arrived from Victoria, told me that the gold
diggings at Bathurst were nearly at an end, and that
he did not believe that any more gold would be
shipped from Sydney. Although Sydney is only
one of the ports of Australia from which gold has
been shipped, this would appear to confirm your
views, that the first gatherings cannot fairly be
assumed as data on which to found estimates of
future production: at the same time when we hear
of so great an increase of production in other parts
of Australia, I can hardly agree with you, that there
is so little ground for alarm as to a depreciation in
the value of gold, in consequence of these late discoveries.
The effects of the production in Australia
can hardly be felt at present, considering that the
export of English gold coin has been, up to this
date, I think, equal to the amount of gold we have
received thence; but when the sovereigns lately
shipped are found to be in excess of the wants
of the community in Australia, and are re-shipped
to this country, together with the produce of the
gold workings between this and next summer, I
cannot but believe that the supply in the market<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
of the world will be found in excess of the demand,
and that ultimately a considerable and general
alteration in prices will ensue.</p>

<p>I shall be very glad if I find that by this translation
I have in any way contributed to increase
the circulation of your remarks in this country.
The subject is one of considerable interest, and
I hope that you will, at no very distant period,
give us some further observations, and let us know
how far your first impressions have been then
influenced by events which may have occurred
subsequently to the present time.</p>

<h1>REMARKS
ON THE PRODUCTION OF
THE PRECIOUS METALS,
&amp;c.</h1>

<p>From the commencement of the 19th century, gold
appears to have been always esteemed in Europe
above the price at which it has been legally fixed
in relation to silver; the commercial value of the
metal has remained on an average about 1 per
cent. above its legal value. In England alone gold
circulates as money: in those countries which have
maintained a double standard, gold, rarely coined,
became immediately an article of merchandize, and
disappeared from circulation. Gold regions were
discovered without restoring the equilibrium of
value between the two metals. Civilization, in its
development from historical times, has but realized
the legends of ancient fables. Gold, from its importance
and constancy of value, appeared likely to
remain for ever the symbol and the essential agent
of wealth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>In this regular course of the progress of the precious
metals, a pause, or rather a deviation, appears
to have occurred. Gold seems to be tottering in its
monetary supremacy; the fortress appears to have
succumbed in a paroxysm of alarm. Ten years
ago, every one was frightened at the prospect of the
depreciation of silver; during the last eighteen
months, it is the diminution in the price of gold
that has been alarming the public. Some countries,
which, but a short time since, were but too anxious
to attract and retain gold in circulation, even at
great sacrifices, have already shown a feverish
anxiety to banish it altogether.</p>

<p>Holland took the lead in this movement, and
in July, 1850, demonetized the gold 10-florin piece
and the Guillaume. Portugal has partially followed
this example, by prohibiting any gold to have a
current value, except English sovereigns. Belgium,
which in order to increase its gold circulation, had
given a legal value to our 20 and 40-franc pieces,
and had struck, in 1847, a mixed coinage of gold
and base alloy, has demonetized its gold circulation,
both home and foreign. Russia, by a ukase of 29th
December, 1850, wishing to maintain the former
equilibrium, has prohibited the export of silver. The
French Government itself, struck with the novelty,
and the sudden change, issued a commission for the
purpose, as the Minister of Finance stated in his
minute of the 14th December, 1850, of examining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
the questions connected with the simultaneous use
of the precious metals, gold and silver, as a circulating
medium of value.</p>

<p>From public authorities, alarm has spread to
private interests, and the price of the precious
metals has experienced in European markets a
very sensible disturbance in value. In the space
of only a few months, the premium of gold has
given way to a reaction, only checked by the tariff.
From 1st July to the 25th December, 1850, the
price of English sovereigns in Paris has fallen about
2 per cent. On the Amsterdam Exchange, the fall
in the price of gold, in the same year, amounted to
4 per cent.; at the same time silver rose in London
almost as much (from 4s. 11½d. the ounce, to
5s. 1⅝d.); the relative value of gold to silver, which
our laws had fixed at 15½ ounces of fine silver to
one of pure gold, and which the constant premium
on gold in Europe had raised in the Spanish tariff
to 15¾, fell to 15¼ in Holland, Belgium, and Hamburg;
in all places where gold, from having been
demonetized, had become a mere article of merchandize;
almost realizing, in fact, the tariff of
Russia, a country where the abundance of gold
and the scarcity of silver had induced a legal relative
value of 15 to 1.</p>

<p>However great the present depreciation of gold,
the depression appeared likely to increase still further,
and the gloomy forebodings of the press have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
added to public alarm. Newspapers of all parties, and
of all countries, prophesied that, under the combined
influence of California and Siberia, the value of gold
would soon fall to nine times that of silver. Whilst
crowds of emigrants were forcing their perilous way
across the Rocky Mountains, or doubling, for economy,
Cape Horn, or, in their impatience, taking
the shorter but dearer passage by Panama, hurrying
on to the capture of the golden fleece, this very
treasure which they were unduly <i>appreciating</i>, was
becoming as unduly <i>depreciated</i> in Europe; the
article, which but six months before bore the greatest
fixity of value, seemed rapidly undergoing an important
change, and to the <i>Auromania</i> of ages, an <i>Aurophobia</i>
appeared to be succeeding. England alone has
shown no sign of fear. During the period of continental
alarm, the Bank of England was not afraid
even to check the export of its gold; as in the beginning
of 1851, the directors raised the rate of discount
from 2½ to 3 per cent., and almost immediately
the exchange turned. The pound sterling, which fell
for a short time to 24 fr. 70 cents., equal to a fall of
2 per cent., rose in a few days to 24 fr. 95 cents.; it
oscillates now between 25 fr. 35 cents., and 25 fr. 45
cents., which is equal to a premium of ½ to ¾ per cent.
upon gold. Again, the mint of Paris, which received
gold by millions in December, 1850, and January,
1851, has seen this influx slacken until its weekly
receipt now scarcely equals its former daily supply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
At the present moment, the oscillations of the
market seem to have terminated; a calm has succeeded
the storm, and the value of the precious
metals seems to be in almost a normal state. The
present moment, then, appears to be a fitting one
to examine if the late disturbing causes were of an
ephemeral nature, or whether they are likely to be
permanent in their effect.</p>

<p>On this important subject, the French Government,
which at first appeared ready to attempt an
immediate solution of the question, did not hesitate
to recognize the necessity of more profound
examination. In the <i>Moniteur</i> of the 15th January,
1851, it is stated, “that the commission of 14th
December, presided over by Mr. Fould, Minister of
Finance, for the examination of the subject of money,
is of opinion, that the late depreciation in the value
of gold has been produced by causes of an accidental
nature, which are beginning to be less sensibly
felt; that influences of a permanent character
bearing upon this depreciation cannot at present
be sufficiently ascertained; and in such a state of
affairs it is necessary to have precise information as
to the production of the precious metals in California
and in Russia; and that with its present knowledge
of facts, the Commission is of opinion, that there is no
ground for a modification in our monetary system.”</p>

<p>This determination was a wise one, and subsequent
events have justified it; while on the one hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
gold has again risen to nearly its former value, and
on the other, the discovery made in 1851 of rich
deposits of gold in Australia, renders the subject
worthy of further investigation; the present seems a
suitable opportunity for the renewal of a controversy
by no means exhausted.</p>

<p>In default of official documents, we have the
stories of the adventurer, and the statistics of commerce.
Sufficient light appears to come from the
north, the south, and the west, to enable us to form
some opinion of the results of the general movement
regarding the precious metals. I would add,
that we can approach the subject now, freed from
some of the questions which appeared to encumber
it; the trade in the precious metals appears to be
again in its natural channels. The phantom of rise
or fall does not appear to be materially affecting
trade: quite lately, to prevent the export of gold, the
Bank of France raised the premium for purchase.
In London and in Paris, the metallic reserves are full.
The Bank of England has above <a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>500,000,000 francs,
and the Bank of France above <a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>600,000,000 in their
vaults. The import of the precious metals goes on
but slowly. Nothing opposes, then, such a patient
and careful examination of the subject as can alone
satisfy the inductions of science.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<h2>I.</h2>

<p>The value attached to the precious metals in
their character of money, is not of an arbitrary
nature. Neither governments nor councils can
change it at their will and pleasure. The power
publicly possessed in this respect is but the organ
of facts, which it submits to and proclaims as law.
The head of the Government stamped on the coin
creates a value only by the declaration of its
intrinsic weight and fineness; but the price of
the gold and the silver is exactly that of their
commercial value in exchange. In this consists the
stability and the regularity of the circulation of
money.</p>

<p>The cause which determines the value of the
precious metals is the same as that which affects
the price of every other article of merchandize; the
supply and the demand&mdash;the comparative abundance
or scarcity of gold or silver in the market. The
larger the metallic supply, the smaller value will it
bear; its commercial value will vary in exact proportion
to the increase in quantity. On the other
hand, the smaller the quantity of money in circulation,
the larger will be the value attaching to
each separate piece; a smaller quantity of such
money will then suffice to buy a larger amount of
goods, and goods are said to be cheap&mdash;or what if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
in effect the same, money,&mdash;may be called dear.
This money, in the time of Charlemagne, possessed
a power eleven times greater than at present&mdash;that
is to say, it was eleven times more scarce. It is
well-known that the discovery of America, in overpowering
with a fresh supply of the precious metals
the metallic circulation of Europe, brought about a
sudden and large depreciation of their value, which,
notwithstanding a variety of oscillations, has been
generally maintained to the present time. Not only
does the state of the market mark the value of <i>gold</i>
and <i>silver</i> with reference to other articles; but
there is positively no other base on which the
comparative value between the two metals can
be determined, but the <i>abundance</i> or <i>scarcity</i> of
either.</p>

<p>The relation between gold and silver is variable
in its nature. In vain has Garnier, the commentator
on Adam Smith, attempted to establish
his position, that the value of gold in ancient times
differed little from its value in our days; and that
it then represented, according to Herodotus, and
under Darius in Persia; and again, during the
time of Plato, in Greece, weight for weight and
purity for purity, about fifteen times the value
of silver. Criticism has not failed to demolish
entirely this ingenious but frail hypothesis. It has
been clearly demonstrated that silver did not hold
in ancient days, the important place it has obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
in ours, and which has subsequently rendered it
the all-powerful agent of circulation.</p>

<p>When we seek to examine minutely the various
monetary changes which have occurred, and to
lay hold upon some principle to guide our inquiry,
we quickly recognize the fact, that the difference
in value between gold and silver increases in proportion
to the development of civilization and
industry. It is not without some show of reason,
that mythology, transporting the analogy of the
physical into the moral world, made the age of
silver succeed that of gold. Historically, in fact,
the discovery of and the working of gold preceded
that of silver. Gold is almost always found
either pure or mixed with silver. In searching
the beds of rivers and streams, it has been obtained
by the mere process of washing. This
work is within the reach of the rudest state of
society. It appears like a treasure spread over the
surface of the earth, under the very feet of the
first occupier of the soil. Silver, on the contrary, is
embedded in rocks of primitive formation, and is
seldom found near the surface of the earth; its
extraction requires a combination of science, machinery,
and capital. It is the work of a state of
civilization already far advanced and firmly established.</p>

<p>In almost every age, whatever its social position,
the use and the value of gold has been known. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
India to Iberia, and from Ethiopia to the Poles,
there is not a race which has not attempted to
discover this source of wealth on its surface. What
country has not had its Pactolus! What Prince or
Satrap has not been a gold collector, like Midas or
Crœsus! The luxuries of ancient monarchs appear
to prove an abundance of metallic treasure, which
has been subsequently unequalled, but the sources of
the supply have faded away in their turn. Dureau de
la Malle observes, that from the death of Alexander,
the golden sands of Asia and Greece appear to have
been exhausted; those of Gaul and Spain seem
to have been abandoned after the fall of the Roman
Empire. Gold has long since disappeared from the
surface of the older inhabited countries; there is
only now to come, in quantities of appreciable
amount, or capable of affecting the circulation, the
produce of those countries which have been unknown
to European commerce, or which have been discovered
in modern times.</p>

<p>Referring to history, we find that the employment
of silver as money is of no very ancient date, and
that it was introduced as a medium of exchange,
not by conquerors, but by people of industry and
of commerce. It would be sufficient to cite
the Phœnicians, those planters of colonies,&mdash;the
Athenians, and the Carthagenians. On the first
discovery of America, silver money was found in
use amongst only two nations holding any political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
position&mdash;Peru and Mexico. And again, if silver at
a later period has taken the place of gold in circulation,
it has been maintained with more regularity
and permanence. The mines&mdash;from wherever it has
been extracted, penetrating into and ramifying
throughout the bowels of the earth,&mdash;are almost
inexhaustible. It is thus shewn that the production
of silver is found to continue where that of gold is
at an end, and hence the variations which past experience
has shown to exist in the relative position
of the precious metals.</p>

<p>The learned researches of Boeckh, Letronne,
Humboldt, Jacob, and Dureau de la Malle have
thrown much light on the causes, and on the importance
of these monetary oscillations. They
agree in the admission, that originally the value of
silver in some countries has equalled, if not exceeded,
that of gold. The laws of <i>Manon</i> state
a value of gold as 2½ times that of silver. M.
Dureau de la Malle considers that between the fifth
and sixth century before our era, everywhere,
excepting in India, the relative value of gold to
silver, had been 6 or 8 to 1, as it was in China and
in Japan at the end of the last century. It has
been found to have been as 10 to 1 in Greece, in
the time of Xenophon, 350 years before the
Christian era; and even 100 years later, the treaty
between Rome and Etolia proves a similar ratio.</p>

<p>In the present day, the discovery and the working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
these new metallic stratifications are the only causes
which can materially change the relative value of
the precious metals. Formerly, conquest, by which
one nation became rich at the expense of another,
or the pillage of those great reservoirs of money
called public treasures, throwing suddenly vast sums
of money into circulation, could not fail to depreciate
either one or other, if not both, of the precious
metals. It was thus that the conquests of Alexander,
opening the gates of the East, inundated the Greek
world with the precious metals, which were lowered
in value by their abundance, and dissipated from
their very excess. After the capture of Syracuse
by the Romans, silver, the foundation of the
treasure they had seized, fell suddenly in price, so
that seventeen pounds of silver were valued at one
of gold. A little later the relative price was as
12 to 1, when Cæsar, having plundered the two
milliards contained in the public chest, so reduced
the value of gold, which then predominated, that
the proportion fell to 9 to 1. Under the Roman
Emperors, the production of gold began to slacken,&mdash;the
progress of mechanical science, on the other
hand, gave a constant impetus to the working of
the silver mines of Asia, Thrace, and Spain. The
comparative value of the two metals again changed;
it was as 18 to 1 in the time of Theodosius the
Younger, 412 years after the birth of Christ.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the fall of the Roman
Empire, in the 4th century, the value of the precious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
metals approached that of our own days. The
invasion of the barbarians, in dispersing and dissipating
the accumulated treasures of the West,
destroyed for a time the industry required for their
renewal. Money, on account of its scarceness,
acquired an extraordinary power; the price of
every article fell, or, in other words, the value of
silver rose to a most extraordinary degree. Not
only did the value of money and of the precious
metals increase in that long dark night of the
middle ages, but the relative value between silver
and gold, which had been established by the
progress of industry, again changed. The value
of gold, in relation to other commodities, was preserved
longer than that of silver, owing to its
greater general value, and to its being the less destructible
metal; and also because its supply was fed
by the washings of the golden sands; a fit occupation
for the knowledge and tastes of an ignorant
people. The working of the silver mines, on the
other hand, being a work befitting a civilized and
scientific people, was naturally interrupted, and
languished during a period of spoliation and endless
warfare. Hence, as we may suppose, arose the
scarcity, both relative and absolute, of silver; the
comparison with gold remained at 11 and 12 to 1
from the 9th to the middle of the 16th century. It
required the excessive and sudden abundance,
springing from the working of the mines of Potosi,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and in Peru, and of Zacatecas in Mexico, to reduce
the proportion to 14 and 15, the average rate at
which it remained in Europe until the end of the
last century.</p>

<h2>II.</h2>

<p>A change in the relative production of the precious
metals does not necessarily alter their monetary
value. In order to create an alteration in the relative
values of gold and silver with the quantities
annually produced, the disturbing cause must be of
a somewhat permanent nature. Moreover, it is
necessary to examine, in connection, either with a
greater or less production, the causes which might
add to or diminish these results; such as expenses
in working, the varied wants of consumption, and
the greater or less destruction of coin by wear and
tear, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Humboldt remarks, that during the
ten years, from 1817 to 1827, there was coined in
Great Britain, above <a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>1,294,000 marcs of gold; that
is nearly one milliard of francs, and more than
<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>100,000,000 francs per annum, without any influence
having been produced by such extensive purchases
on the relation of gold to silver: the proportion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
which was as 1 to 14·97, never exceeded
1 to 15·60; or shewing a rise of not more than 4²⁄₁₀
per cent. Such was the case when England, which
for above twenty years had had only a paper
circulation, re-established a metallic currency, and
attracted the coin and the bars of gold dispersed
throughout Europe. During these ten years she
absorbed, or nearly absorbed, an amount of gold
which perhaps equalled the production of the whole
world, and certainly exceeded the import of gold,
during that period, into all the great commercial
depots in the civilized world. It would not enter
into our subject to examine at what sacrifices
England made this monetary revival; but the
equilibrium once restored, and the empire of Britain
having placed herself in harmony with the rest
of Europe, it does appear wonderful that it did
not cost more than a premium of 4 per cent.
to have attracted a quantity of gold, probably
equal to the half or one-third of that possessed
by the whole of Europe. And the wonder increases
when we remember, that the Mint of London, which
in 1814, 1815, and 1816, had not coined a single
sovereign, issued at once, in 1825, £9,520,758 sterling
(about 240,000,000 of francs), which must have
been consequently abstracted from trade in the
course of a few months. Political commotions
brought about other variations in the price of the
precious metals. It is well known, that on the news<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of the landing of Napoleon in 1815, gold rose 10
per cent. in London.</p>

<p>To explain how this sudden collection of gold,
effected by Great Britain with as much perseverance
as vigour, did not bring about a general crisis;
it has been said, and not without reason, that the
quantity of the precious metals now existing in
the shape of money, rendered the oscillations in its
production and supply as money, less sensibly felt.
It should be recollected, that if the metallic values
were so greatly depreciated by the discoveries of
America, this state referred to the existing condition
of Europe, exhausted both of silver and gold. The
difference thus exhibited between the two periods is
very evident; but it does not appear to be sufficient
to account for the facility with which the circulation
may increase in the present day, without affecting the
price of silver or gold. It may be as well to add, that
this movement, which appears to convey life throughout
every artery of commerce, is not fed now solely,
as in olden times, and during the middle ages, by the
precious metals. Metallic money now forms but a
small portion of the total circulation, if we take into
account the mass of bank notes, bills of exchange,
drafts and bankers’ cheques, which complete the
amount of a circulating medium of exchange; this,
at the present day, taken as a whole, is something
almost indefinite: it appears to defy all calculation;
and we might almost say that the excess in the production<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
of gold and silver now need not necessarily
produce more influence than the waves of the sea
on the permanent level of the ocean.</p>

<p>At the same time that the depreciation of gold
and silver under any general form becomes less
probable, the increasing facility of communication,
and the greater mutual dependence of nations in
matters of credit, renders any great local difference
in the value of money more improbable. Whenever
the precious metals become in excess in one
country, the surplus quickly reaches its neighbour.
Let a sudden scarcity of food, or any other cause,
create a drain of specie, the consequently increased
value of money will soon draw back that which
has been exported. The cost of transport, and
the premium of insurance of gold, are the limits
of the variations in the rates of exchange; and
the charges are being diminished every day, thanks
to railroads and steam communications. Before
the wonderful progress in the development of
industry from the commencement of the nineteenth
century, we have seen the changes occurring
at different periods, in the relative production of
the precious metals, without any corresponding
alteration in their relative values. At the close
of the fifteenth century, it is true, that America,
furnishing nothing but gold, and this metal having
accumulated in Spain, Queen Isabella of Castile
was forced to alter the relative standard of gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and silver. After the first half of the 16th
century, the production of gold having ceased to
preponderate, and silver being imported in great
abundance, the value of the inferior metal underwent
such a depreciation, that the governments of
Europe, yielding to the force of circumstances,
changed its relative legal value; but with these two
exceptions in the monetary laws, one purely local,
and the other European, we observe the production
of each metal extend and diminish alternately,
without any relative alteration in value of sufficient
importance to attract public attention.</p>

<p>“From the year 1645 to the commencement
of the 18th century,” says M. Michel Chevalier,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
“silver took the lead in a most remarkable manner.
Then occurred the bright days of the mines in
Potosi, and the production of silver exceeded that
of gold, weight for weight, in the proportion of 60
to 1; after that, and without any diminution in the
produce of silver, came the glorious time for the
Brazilian gold mines. Simultaneously appeared
the auriferous regions of Chico, Antioguia, and
Pepayou. The commercial world received from
America 1 kilogramme <a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>of gold for every 30 kilogrammes
of silver. Thus passed the middle of the
17th century. Then the silver mines of Mexico
put forth all their splendour, and the proportion
increased to 40 to 1. The Brazilian mines began
to diminish, whilst those of Mexico continued to
increase in production; and, at the beginning of
the next century, silver exceeded gold in the proportion
of 57 to 1. In 1846 the production of silver
still continued to predominate, and we are now at
the proportion again of about 40 to 1.”</p>

<p>Humboldt’s calculations differ but little from
those of M. Michel Chevalier. This great authority
considers that the import of gold until the first years
in the 18th century, bore the proportion to silver
of 1 to 65. Let either of these suppositions be
true, there can be little doubt, that the relative
weight of supply of the two metals varied by one
half, without any serious alteration in their relative
price; which surely proves that gold was essentially
required, and that the increase of production
did but fill up the gap, which, as far as the 18th
century, the progress of civilization and of luxury
had created, without an adequate means of supply.</p>

<p>In ancient times, the relative value of the two
metals appears to have been almost entirely
governed by the quantities produced and brought
to market. A pound of gold was worth eight or
ten pounds of silver, according as the quantity
brought to market varied in the like proportion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
The simplicity of commercial interests, in a state
of society when neither luxurious arts or industry
were thought of, offered no inducements for the collection
of gold or silver for their use as money,
excepting on account of their relative scarcity;
but when fighting ceased to be the principal occupation
of mankind, and labour began to be held in
some estimation, an end was put to this patriarchal
state: if the people lost their primitive simplicity,
the relation of supply and demand no longer depended
exclusively on the proportionate production
of the two metals; other causes affecting a rise and
fall began to operate on prices.</p>

<p>When the precious metals were nearly absorbed
in the supply of money, their commercial value had
no other element to influence an alteration than
the requirements of circulation; the monetary value
governed the commercial price. But, at the present
time the contrary is the case: the greater the degree
of civilization, and the greater the increase of a
taste for luxuries, the more does the demand for
the precious metals for other objects exceed the
want of them for coin. Mr. Jacob, whose work
on the precious metals appeared in 1831, places
a value of <a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>149,000,000 francs on the gold and silver
annually used for articles of jewellery and plate in
Europe and America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>During the last twenty years the progress of
luxury amongst the industrious and commercial
nations of the world has been enormous. The
moveable wealth of France and England has made
prodigious accumulations. What family is there so
poor as not to have some article of plate? Gilding
is no longer confined to the decorations of temples
and palaces; it is found in the most humble cottage.
To what a length may it not reach if the taste
should increase for gilding the dresses of ladies, and
for covering the uniforms of our men with gold or
silver lace?</p>

<p>On the whole, then, it appears that the demand
for gold and silver, as articles of commerce, is likely
to exceed the demand for the precious metals solely
for use as money. This is a new point; and
we must not lose sight of it in endeavouring to
appreciate the effect which an increase or diminution
in the production of the precious metals may
have, both on their price and on their relative
value.</p>

<p>Without noting the variations which have occurred
from one century to another, in the production
and in the importation of gold and silver, in
order to recapitulate the quantities of the precious
metals which America has poured into the European
markets in 318 years, from the discovery of
Hispaniola to the revolution in Mexico, M. de
Humboldt considers the production of gold to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
been <a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>2,381,600 kilogrammes, and that of silver
<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>110,362,222 kilogrammes: making a total value of
about <a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>32 “milliards” of francs: the weight of gold
imported represents about ¹⁄₄₇th of that of silver.
It does not appear probable, that the produce of
gold in other parts during these three centuries has
materially altered these proportions. Admitting that
when first the Mexican revolution retarded the
working of their silver mines, the amount of coined
money throughout Europe represented a value of <a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>8
“milliards” of francs, of which <a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>6 “milliards” were
in silver, and <a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>2 “milliards” in gold, the relative
quantity in weight would still have been as 47 to 1;
and yet the relative monied value, thirty years since,
varied in Europe between 1 to 14½, and 1 to 15¾.
Thus, in the value of the precious metals, the difference
was three times less than in their weight.</p>

<p>Nothing is more difficult in matters relating to
money than to present statistics which may be
considered as an approximation to truth. It would
appear that as gold and silver are used as the denominators
of value, generally, throughout the world,
all the phenomena connected with their production
and circulation ought to be noted with the greatest
precision: they ought to be the points to which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
attention of statisticians should be “<i>par excellence</i>”
directed. What can be more important, in an economical
point of view, than to establish a regular
scale, indicating the rapidity of every movement
connected with the subject, and acting as a gauge
of its extent?</p>

<p>Divers causes appear, however, hitherto to have
prevented such a desideratum. In the first place,
gold and silver producing countries have generally
been in a rude state of civilization; and as unable
to apply rules for the public weal, as to employ
machinery to aid their industry. Thus, even in the
registry in Mexico under the Spanish rule, of all
the money coined at their mint, and for ascertaining
the amount produced in the mines by the proportion
of the tax due to government, which ought
to be levied thereon by the hundred-weight,&mdash;it is
absolutely necessary to take into account all that
quantity which escapes the vigilance of the tax-collector,
and which is either sent into the interior,
or exported clandestinely.</p>

<p>What is the sum of the precious metals really
produced at any given time? What is the proportion
of such production which, when exported,
acts as a regulator of the prices in Europe? How
are the channels formed which sometimes direct
the stream of commerce towards the east, and
sometimes towards the west, in the distribution
of the metallic wealth of the world? All such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
problems, as regards the past, must probably remain
unsolved. The enquiry becomes more easy when
referring to our own times; but even then large
allowances for incorrectness of data must necessarily
be made.</p>

<p>At the beginning of this century, according to
M. de Humboldt, gold and silver were imported
annually into Europe in the relative proportions of
about 1 to 55; that is, <a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>15,800 kilogrammes of gold
to <a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>869,960 kilogrammes of silver. M. Michel Chevalier,
stating, not the import but the production,
calculates it at <a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>23,700 kilogrammes of gold against
<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>900,000 kilogrammes of silver, or in the proportion
of 1 to 38; but the gold of Africa and Asia, comprised
in this statement, never really found its way
into European markets except in the smallest quantities,
and in such amounts as could have no appreciable
influence on the commercial prices of the
metals. From 1810 to 1830, according to Mr.
Jacob, the produce of America diminished by one
half. As the reduction refers principally to silver,
that is to say, to those mines which required both
capital and labor, it is fair to assume that, at least
during the first part of this period, the relative
proportion of gold to silver would have increased;
but we have no means of verifying figures which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
appear to justify what would otherwise rest solely
on the analogy of the case.</p>

<p>In 1847, when the general working of the
auriferous region of the Oural Mountains was at
its meridian, M. Chevalier considers the annual
production of gold throughout the world to have
been <a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>63,250 kilogrammes, and that of silver
<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>875,000 kilogrammes. This would be <a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>25,000
kilogrammes <i>less</i> of silver, and <a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>30,000 kilogrammes
<i>more</i> of gold, than at the beginning of the century.
At these figures gold stands in reference to silver
as 1 to 14. The return from these gold regions
appears to have been greatly over-estimated. I find
in a table, published in the “<i>Times</i>” of May, 1852,
statements which appear to be founded on correct
data, and which bring the production of gold up to
42,800 kilogrammes&mdash;that is, to <a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>147,400,000 francs.</p>

<p>This result, then, is remarkable. The 17th century
produced 1 lb. of gold to 60 lb. of silver. In the
18th century the production was as 1 lb. to 30 lbs.
At the beginning of the 19th century silver was
again abundant, and appeared in quantity as 1 to 50.
Towards the year 1847 the production of gold again
increased, and the relative proportions were as 1 to
20. The development of the Siberian mines, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
has so materially changed the relative production of
the two metals, has produced no sensible alteration
in price. Will it be the same with the wonderful
discoveries in California and Australia? To solve
this question, it will be desirable to examine accurately
the actual state of the production of gold and
silver throughout the world.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2>III.</h2>

<p>Before entering into this inquiry, it may be
worth while to examine a circumstance of late
occurrence, relating to monetary statistics, which
has given rise to some discussion, but which has
not yet been explained; I allude to the fall in the
price of gold, and the corresponding rise in that of
silver, throughout Europe, towards the end of 1850
and the beginning of 1851.</p>

<p>At that period Russia had rather less gold than
usual to exchange against the produce of the West;
and since 1847 the working of the Altai mines had
been on the decline: at all events, the government did
not appear inclined to allow gold to be exchanged;
for in 1848 and 1849 its export had been forbidden.
In 1850 the state of the exchanges did not admit
of an export of gold, and a part of the 4½ per cent.
loan, contracted at that period by the Cabinet of St.
Petersburg, was remitted to Russia, both in gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and silver, from England. Doubtless, in spite of
the prohibition, Russian gold found its way into
other parts of Europe; it was calculated that
between 1849 and the first few months of 1850,
the great commercial towns in Western Europe
must have received from <a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>60,000,000 to <a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>70,000,000
francs from Russia; but this was not equivalent to
the large sums paid for grain imported from Odessa
and Riga during the famine of 1846-1847. There
could have been no real increase in the metallic
reserves of Western Europe during that period.</p>

<p>The same remark will hold good towards America.
The import of gold thence in 1849 and 1850 could
not have done more than replace the gold coin
exported to the United States two years earlier, in
payment of bread stuffs and salt provisions. A
proof of this will be found by examining the official
reports of the mints of the United States. These
mints, which from the year 1834&mdash;that is, since the
working of the gold fields of Carolina, had coined
gold at the average rate of 2,500,000 dollars
(<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>13,500,000 francs) per annum, in 1847 put into
circulation about 20,000,000 dollars (<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>104,000,000
francs). At that time Californian gold was unknown:
the rich “<i>placers</i>” of that country did not begin
to kindle the gold fever, first in America, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
subsequently in Europe, until 1848. Californian
gold, before it found its way to the Old World,
had to supply the wants of the New. It is
exported thence in the shape of eagles and double
eagles, bearing the stamp of the Republic. In
1848 the coined gold in the United States did
not amount to <a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>4,000,000 dollars, and it did not
exceed <a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>9,000,000 in 1849. With this small supply
an export could not be expected. In 1850 the
Californian stream began to flow, and the mint
of the United States, having received gold dust
and bars to the extent of <a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>40,000,000 dollars, coined
<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>32,000,000 (about 171,000,000 francs.) Supposing
that the bulk of this coin had been exported to
Europe, such a supply would but have restored
the loss in the circulating medium which had occurred
in 1846. We had exchanged our gold
against grain; it was returned to us against the
silks, wines, and other articles from France. The
monetary disturbance of 1850 must not therefore
be set down to the score of an excess of imports:
the rich supplies from Siberia and California
could then only have acted prospectively.
The real cause is to be found in the measures
hastily and somewhat rashly adopted by various
European governments. To prevent future evil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
they created immediate mischief; and, in order to
shelter themselves from the risk of a future depreciation
of gold, they directly produced it.</p>

<p>The crisis of 1850, thus examined, explains
itself. On the one hand, silver, being annually
taken out of the market by circulation, was not
to be met with for other demands; on the other
hand, gold, excluded by some governments from
their circulation, flowed to those countries where it
was still used as legal coin, and produced there, at
least, a temporary superabundance. Then occurred
the fall in the price of gold, and the rise in the price
of silver; which together shewed a divergence of
8 per cent. between their former relative prices.</p>

<p>The explanation we have endeavoured to give
appears to become clearer as we investigate
further into the subject. Let us first examine the
facts relating to the scarcity of silver. England,
the principal market of Europe for the precious
metals, witnessed, in 1850, a reduction of about
<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>27,000,000 francs in the ordinary import. This
applied principally to silver. Remittances from
India, generally about <a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>20,000,000 fr., were almost
completely stopped; those from Turkey and Spain
were materially diminished. At the same time about
£1,000,000 sterling was required to be shipped to
India, and remittances were made by Messrs. Baring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
to St. Petersburg of <a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>8,000,000 to <a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>10,000,000
francs more, in silver. Germany and Holland required
more than their usual supply. The
Société Maritime of Berlin had imported silver to
the extent of <a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>3,000,000 or <a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>4,000,000 thalers; so
that, altogether, the import into England, having
diminished in 1850 to the extent of about £1,000,000
sterling, the export had been in excess by about
double that amount; reducing the metallic reserve
by about <a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>75,000,000 francs. In addition to which,
Spain and Russia, having prohibited the export
of silver, the exchanges with those countries could
hardly be operated upon effectively by the transmission
of this kind of specie. It is easy, then,
to conceive, that where no modification of the
monetary laws had taken place, the premium on
gold passed to a premium on silver.</p>

<p>This will explain the reason for at least a
temporary abundance and depression in the price
of gold, especially on the gold market of Paris.
There is no ground for imputing the change to
California, from whence the supplies were of little
moment, until the end of December, 1850. England
so far had only received silver from the United
States, and the Californian gold, which had found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
its way by Panama, during the year, did not
exceed, according to official returns, £682,000,
or 17,050,000 francs. The Mint in London did
not coin gold to a greater extent in 1850 than
£1,492,000, or 37,300,000 francs, which is conclusive
against any very large importation.</p>

<p>The market of Paris might have experienced
a superabundance of gold, in consequence of the
demonetization of gold coin in Spain and Portugal,
and by the influx of Belgian and other foreign gold
coin which had been circulating in Belgium; and
it should be added, that England imported into
France, for the payment of railway shares, probably
to the extent of £1,000,000 sterling; but
the predominating cause of the depreciation was
undoubtedly the demonetization of gold in Holland,
for that step had the immediate effect of cancelling
at once the value of the gold coin there in circulation,
and of throwing simultaneously an amount
of gold on the commercial market, almost equal
to the whole of the annual quantity of gold produced
in California.</p>

<p>From 1816 to 1847 Holland had followed the
example of France in admitting a double monetary
standard. Gold and silver were both received in
legal payment. The law of November 26th, 1847,
altered this state of things; one standard only was
allowed, and the silver florin of 3 grammes 450
milligrammes fineness, became the monetary unit:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
this simplification of the national coin, however,
was adopted in theory only; the application of
the system was postponed.</p>

<p>The article 23 of the law decreed, that before
December 31st, 1850, other legislative arrangements
should be enacted concerning the gold coins of five
and ten florins, but that till these new arrangements
were carried out, the gold coin should continue in
legal circulation. The Dutch government might,
therefore, retain the legal circulation of the gold
coin, by applying to the States-General to prolong
the period of the law of November 26th, 1847; but
it preferred to carry out the system to its fullest
extent. On August 6th, 1849, the government
laid before the Assembly, the scheme of a law
to “demonetize” the pieces of five and ten florins,
and leaving to the administration the moment for
its execution. At the same time the government
demanded authority for the issue of notes to the
amount of <a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>30,000,000 florins, to buy in the gold
coin, which although not in legal circulation, might
yet continue to serve as payment at its conventional
value.</p>

<p>In the “<i>Exposé des Motifs</i>,” the Minister of Finance,
M. Van Hall, acknowledged that the depreciation
of gold would not be immediate. “We must examine
the question,” he said, “in order to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
whether the proportionate value of gold and silver
has undergone much variation in consequence of
the discovery of the Californian mines. The government
is of opinion that as yet this is not the case.
In fact, a document communicated to the Assembly
proves that the proportion between gold and silver
of 1 to 15·60 has been found to exist but once.
Sixty-eight quotations of the Exchange of Paris
mark the price of gold higher, and only four lower
than this proportion; at the Exchange at Amsterdam,
we find fifty-five quotations above, and fifteen only
below. For the present there is no fear of too much
gold being imported for the purpose of exporting
silver. It should also be observed, that the high
price of gold in France has latterly been occasioned
by political events.</p>

<p>“It is well known that the price of gold in
Holland is regulated by the exchange on London.
If England sends more gold to the Continent than
she receives from it, then the rate of exchange
on London rises, and gold is obtainable only at an
agio. On the contrary, if England receives from
the Continent more gold than she exports, the exchange
on London is low in Holland, and gold is
plentiful. Peculiar circumstances may of course
modify these general rules; for instance, it is possible
that England may have payments to make in Holland
greater than Holland has in England, while
the case is the reverse between England and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
other countries of Europe; then the state of exchange
in those countries would naturally react upon
ours.</p>

<p>“It often happens that other circumstances occur
seeming to contradict these principles. Thus in
August last (1849), pieces of ten florins were in
demand in Holland for foreign remittances, although
the price of bar gold was only at 1¾ per cent. agio.
Again, the influence of the state of exchange on
the importation of gold may recently have been
observed; not long ago, gold was exported from
England to the United States at the very moment
that gold was supposed to be arriving from America
in great quantities.” I have repeated at full length
these remarkable admissions, to prove that the Dutch
government was not arming itself against a pressing
or even nearly approaching danger, and that
their precautions were not even taken with foresight.
To theoretical errors were added practical
faults; the Minister of Finance had not measured
the importance of the operation with sufficient
accuracy; he estimated the amount of gold coin
in Holland at <a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>96,500,000 florins; it proved to be
<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>172,000,000 florins.</p>

<p>The law was voted on September 17th, 1849, and
the government received the full power they had
demanded. A royal command appeared on June<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
9th, for the execution of the measure. The following
are the principal articles: “1st. The pieces of
ten and five florins shall cease to be in circulation
as legal payment from Sunday, June 23rd, 1850,
but they may continue to be employed in commerce:
that is to say, that these coins may be accepted
in payment at a conventional value. 2nd. These
coins shall be received in payment by government,
and by the collectors of the revenues of
the kingdom, at their nominal value, till July 31st,
1850, inclusive.”</p>

<p>At the time this notice was published, it appeared
that the exchange of gold for bank-notes
would take place under the most favourable auspices.
Gold was at a tolerably high premium in the market
of Amsterdam, bills of exchange on foreign countries
were scarce, and consequently the payments of
international commerce could very advantageously
be made in the precious metals. Moreover, the
government treasury was full, and the Netherlands
bank declared itself ready to assist efficiently in the
operation. But all these chances of success were
destroyed by the precipitancy of the government.
A complete panic was occasioned by the short
period granted to the holders of gold coin: the
people hastened to pour their gold into the state
treasury, (which could not receive it all) or else to
send it abroad. The government had imagined
that the sum likely to be exchanged, would no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
exceed <a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>30,000,000 florins: they had miscalculated
by two-fifths; for the sum amounted to <a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>50,000,000
florins. The 30,000,000 of paper money that they
had been authorized to issue, together with the
money in the treasury at their disposal, not being
sufficient to pay for the amount of gold presented,
they were obliged to have recourse to the bank of
the Netherlands, and to borrow a sum of <a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>6,500,000
florins, at an interest, moderate it must be admitted,
of 2½ per cent. per annum.</p>

<p>The exchange being effected, it was necessary for
the government to find a means of disposing of the
gold withdrawn from circulation. It could be sold
only in foreign markets; and there, private industry
had forestalled the government, and the price of
gold had fallen in consequence of the number of
Guillaumes brought for sale. At first the Dutch
government suffered only a small loss, owing to
a momentary reaction in favour of gold coin; but
the first sales having increased the depreciation, they
were obliged, for fear of greatly adding to their loss,
to stop after having disposed of <a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>21,836,000 florins:
the loss then amounted to <a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>244,446 florins, being
about 1¹²⁄₁₀₀ per cent. By the middle of October,
gold had fallen in value 2½ per cent. below the legal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
price, and by the middle of December, 4 per cent.
At this period, the pieces of five and ten florins,
banished from Holland, were scattered about in
the different markets of Europe: London had received
them to the amount of £600,000; Paris to
the amount of <a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>63,000,000 francs; Germany had
absorbed the rest: excepting from <a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>28,000,000 to
<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>29,000,000 florins, still lying unsold in the treasury
of the Netherlands.</p>

<p>The Guillaumes have continued to be melted
and coined, in Paris, into 20 and 40 franc pieces;
for I find in an official record furnished me by the
President of the Mint, that Dutch coin was exchanged
at Paris in the last six months of 1850, to
the amount of <a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>40,934,053 francs; and in the first
six months of 1851, to the amount of <a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>70,901,597
francs,&mdash;altogether <a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>111,835,650 francs.</p>

<p>The gold coinage of Holland, from 1816 to 1847,
was 172,583,955 florins, equal to <a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>362,000,000
francs. Supposing that of this only two-thirds
was in existence in this shape of coin in 1850,
there would be 115,000,000 florins, or <a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>236,000,000
francs, all at once withdrawn from circulation,
and thrown upon the gold market: is it possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
that the price of gold could be otherwise than
affected? The gold thus suddenly demonetized
equalled at least twice the annual produce of the
world, previous to the discovery of California.
The Mint of Paris alone, which had not struck
above <a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>27,000,000 francs in gold during the year
1849, coined <a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>85,000,000 in 1850, and <a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>269,000,000
in 1851.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the crisis was of short duration; the
gold coined in Paris rapidly flowed either towards
Piedmont, to pay the first instalment of their loan, or
to Milan to pay for silks bought by Lyons and St.
Etienne. Credit is at a low ebb in Italy, there is
little paper circulation, tending to simplify accounts,
and taking the place of specie in the adjustment of
debts; gold is therefore always in demand, and the
supply was speedily absorbed. Certainly, the apprehensions
of the Dutch Government have proved
hitherto groundless, and the desired object has been
but partially attained: silver, having become the
sole standard, has found its way (somewhat in excess)
throughout the country, but the loss of gold
coin has given rise to a small note paper-circulation:
there is now a paper money of 10 and 5 florins
(21 francs and 10½), which, although at first but
provisionally issued, will probably become permanent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
circulation. Holland is following the steps
of Prussia and Austria. The Dutch Government
supposed that, notwithstanding the demonetization
of gold, the coinage might remain in circulation, and
be voluntarily accepted for its <i>intrinsic</i> value. This
was a misconception of the nature of money, which
is accepted as a circulating medium only on account
of its <i>positive</i> value. As might have been anticipated,
gold has ceased to circulate in Holland, and
paper has taken its place. It is doubtful whether
the nation has gained by the change.</p>

<p>We think we have sufficiently considered the
subject of the fall in price of gold in 1850. During
the last eighteen months the production of this
metal has made immense progress. The crisis,
which was then imaginary, may have taken a more
serious turn, and may become hereafter a reality.
This we will now examine.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2>IV.</h2>

<p>The three great gold districts, which have lately
grown into importance, are, the chain of the Oural
and Altai Mountains, California, and its extensions
to Sonora and Oregon, and the eastern and
southern districts of Australia; let us consider each
in its order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The washings of the Russian streams first aroused
public attention from the languor into which the
question of gold-working had fallen. The deposits
of the Oural, where the first discoveries were made,
never gave any extraordinary results; the workings
appeared almost impracticable above the 60th degree
of latitude, and although begun on a great
scale above half a century ago, they have remained
almost stationary for the last fifteen years; the
annual returns, divided about equally between the
government and private individuals, scarcely exceeded
<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>5,000 kilogrammes.</p>

<p>The Altai gold district was in a very different
position; in spite of the rigour of an inhospitable
climate, and the difficulties experienced from any
work of labour with a scanty population, the development
of produce was extremely rapid. Begun
in 1828, the result, after the first eight years, was
<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>1,722 kilogrammes, but from that time it increased
in a geometrical proportion; it rose to <a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>4,000 kilogrammes
in 1840, to <a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>10,000 in 1842, and exceeded
<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>20,000 in 1847.</p>

<p>The year 1847 appears to have been the culminating
point of the position of gold in Russia. The
“<i>Administration des Mines</i>” report a produce of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>1744 pouds, or <a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>28,521 kilogrammes, as the combined
working of the Oural and Altai; admitting that
one-fifth of the produce escaped the government tax,
the result of the gold produce of 1847, would be at
least <a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>110,000,000 francs. From that time the decrease
has been continuous. The official reports of
1848, give the figures at 1,726 pouds, or <a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>28,252
kilogrammes; 1592 pouds, or <a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>26,077 kilogrammes in
1849; 1485 pouds, or <a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>124,324 kilogrammes in 1850;
and 1,432 pouds, or <a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>78,000,000 francs in 1851. It
is to be observed that the reduction refers exclusively
to Siberia, east and west; not only has the activity of
the workings in the Oural been undiminished, but it
has slightly increased: the produce of 1849 was 342
pouds, being <a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>244 kilogrammes more than in 1845.</p>

<p>The decrease of production appears to have been
principally caused by excessive taxation. The
working of the Siberian gold districts is divided
between the Government and private owners, and in
the division, the eastern side of the mountains has
been retained by the former, whilst the latter have
worked the western. The result has been an immense
loss to the public treasury, for whilst two-fifths of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the washings of the Oural are from the government
reserves, the Altai districts do not yield above 5
to 6 per cent. of this produce. The Russian government
has endeavoured to collect by taxation what
is lost either by abstraction or the washings. The
tax was at first one-tenth of the net produce; it
was then raised to 15 per cent., and has since been
further increased. The new tax, however, only
applies to Siberia, east and west. It is a progressive
rate, divided amongst ten classes, the rate
varying from 5 per cent. on the raw produce, when
the working was from one to two pouds, up to 32
per cent. when the working amounted to 50 pouds
per annum. The whole tax, however, was, in
addition to another tax called “minier,” also progressive,
and varying, according to class, from four
to <a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>ten roubles per pound of gold.</p>

<p>These exorbitant taxes may have acted in two
ways, either as an encouragement to fraud, or as a
discouragement to production. At the distance at
which we live from Siberia, a country where the
light of public opinion has penetrated even less than
the rays of the sun, it is difficult to decide between
these two consequences, both perhaps equally probable.
But the fact of the decrease remains undoubted,
and this decrease has been to the extent of one-seventh
in three years, or about <a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>4,000 kilogrammes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>The working of the gold regions of Siberia has
not been of the democratic character which it has
assumed in California and Australia. There the
first comer, provided he were furnished with a
pickaxe, a bowl, a cradle, and a small store of provisions,
might, without further capital, pitch his tent
over some square yards of land, and dig until he
has made his fortune. With a license costing 60s.
in Australia, and with a tax of 20 dollars a year in
California, he may go where he pleases. It is not
the government which fixes his boundary, but the
regulations of the republic of miners, forming a community
along the banks of a river, or at the foot of
a hill, forbidding one man to usurp a greater space
than he can work with his own hands; the miner
himself possessing nothing, and therefore, risking
nothing, may dispense with all calculations of
profit and loss. If the spot he has selected does not
answer his expectations, he shifts his ground, or his
occupation. Under any circumstances, the tax, not
bearing upon capital, and being moderate in amount,
is easily paid; a few days work is sufficient for it;
the remainder of his time during the year with his
bad or good luck, is at his own free disposal. Such
is not the case, in the Altai, where the aristocratic
forms attaching to all industry, either at the will of
the state, or from the force of circumstances, have
exerted their influence over the first commencement
of working the mineral districts. By the terms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the imperial decrees, concessions are only obtained
on special application, and for a term of twelve years,
and the portion assigned to each person never exceeds
100 sagenes (about <a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>250 metres) by five wersts,
(about 5335 metres); the same person may, however,
take several lots, provided they are separated
by a distance of five wersts. These contractors engage
a certain number of workmen, whom they provide
with utensils and machinery, besides feeding
them and paying them high wages. Everything
connected with the arrangements entails considerable
advance of capital, and when the chance of a
small return, or sometimes of no return at all, is
added to the heavy deduction to be paid to the state,
out of the raw material, is it surprizing that members
of this community are frequently unwilling to
extend their operations, and almost always anxious
to conceal the magnitude of their working?</p>

<p>It is said, that in keeping up the amount of the
tax, the Russian Government has had less in view
the advantage of a larger participation of interests
than a desire to check a kind of industry very
demoralizing in its nature. If such is really the
motive, it might be less critically censured. Whatever
the reason, so long as the Russian Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
considers it advisable to keep up the present taxation,
it is not likely that the increase of production
of gold will be considerable; it appears to be limited
for the present to an amount probably not exceeding
<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>90,000,000 to <a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>100,000,000 francs per annum.</p>

<p>The Spaniards&mdash;those indefatigable treasure-seekers&mdash;who
discovered the hidden riches of the
Cordilleras, had been in possession of California
for above two centuries. From the year 1602,
Sebastian Viscaino, the founder of Monterey, had
learnt from the Indians, dispersed throughout that
country, that it abounded in gold and silver.
Nevertheless, instead of planting a colony of miners
to examine the soil, the Spaniards sent thither a
body of missionaries, who proclaimed the gospel,
and at the same time instructed the natives in the
rudiments of civilization and of agriculture.</p>

<p>In 1846 there was scarcely 10,000 of the original
Spanish creoles, when a body of some hundreds of
adventurers from the United States, under General
Taylor, invaded and took possession of the country.
The Government of the Union, in demanding its
cession from Mexico, thought chiefly of an aggrandisement
of territory; they wanted ports on the
Pacific and a rival colony to Oregon. Little was it
expected that in the valleys which descended from
the Sierra Nevada would be found mines of gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
likely to become the principal attractions to colonization,
and a district whose exuberant products would
be shortly disseminated throughout the markets of
Europe, as well as of America.</p>

<p>The extension of the population of California
which so speedily occurred, is greatly due to the
truly fabulous success of the first washings; the
miners naturally first planted themselves on the
richest “placers,” they rather culled the produce,
than exhausted it; they frequently discovered
“pépites” weighing several ounces, if not pounds
of gold; a clever workman made his fortune in a
few days.</p>

<p>In June, 1848, Mr. Larkin, Consul of the United
States at Monterey, valued the day’s work of a
gold seeker at an average of 15 to 25 dollars
(<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>133 to 267 francs). Colonel Mason, in his report
of August, considered the produce of a day’s work
of 4,000 European or Indian miners at <a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>30,000
to 40,000 dollars, giving an average of about 10
dollars <a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>(53 francs) to each workman. Captain
Folson writes about a month later, “I do not think
that there can exist richer deposits in the world.
I have myself ascertained that an active workman
can collect from <a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>25 to 40 dollars per day, valuing
the gold at 16 dollars the ounce.” Mr. Butler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
King, whose report is of still later date, places the
average day’s work per man at about 16 dollars, or
one ounce of gold.</p>

<p>During the second period of working, when
the miners flocked to the “placers,” and disputed
every inch of the golden soil, the yield began to
diminish in a very marked degree. A local mining
journal, the “<i>Placer Times</i>,” of 26th October, 1850,
giving a <i>resumé</i> of the proceedings of the season,
including the encampment from the River de la
Plume to the River Consumnes, covering an extent
of about 100 miles, and occupied by 60,000 gold-seekers,
estimated the mean result of a day’s work
at from six dollars on the River de la Plume, to four
dollars on the l’Yuba and Ours, and five dollars on
the American Fork. The information collected by
our consuls at the beginning of 1850, gives a result
of one to two ounces per day in the Valley of the
Sacramento, and from one to four in the newer
regions of St. Joaquim. The diminishing produce,
comparing one year with the other, was not without
some compensation. If the miner gained less, he did
not spend as much. The extravagant rise on all sorts
of provisions, clothes, and tools, had been brought
down to a more reasonable limit:&mdash;they no longer
paid <a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>one dollar for a pound of bread; <a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>eighty
dollars for an outer covering; <a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>fifty dollars a-day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
for the use of a cart with two oxen, or <a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>5000 dollars
for a cask of brandy. An artizan could no longer
command sixteen dollars for a day’s work. Europe,
the United States, and other nations, shipped to California
cargoes of provisions and of manufactured
goods; competition soon lowered the prices. Roads
were made from the “placers” to San Francisco;
bridges were thrown over the rivers; they established
stores of provisions and merchandize at every
canteen. Towns sprung up like mushrooms, and
in 1850 San Francisco numbered 50,000 inhabitants.
The production of gold in California appears
to have now arrived at its third period. The
miners have acquired a certain experience, their
modes of working are less primitive, and they are
more settled. The want of order is diminishing, and
the average produce is increasing. The accounts
from San Francisco in April, 1852, mentioned
“placers” in the valley of the Sacramento, where
a day’s working yielded from <a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>fifteen to twenty
dollars, and others on the frontier of Oregon, where
the average was from <a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>five to ten. On the frontier of
Sonora the washings of the auriferous clay yielded
<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>seven to eight dollars a day with the roughest
description of work; all agreed that eight hours
hard work should produce everywhere from six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to <a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>eight dollars, if the plain be rich; and as the
miner could live on from <a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>two to three dollars a
day, he might reckon on a gain of from <a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>400 to
500 dollars during the season. However, by the
latest accounts, it would appear that the “placers”
are beginning to be exhausted. 100,000 miners
turning over continuously for three years the alluvial
sands, (already successfully explored by the
first comers in 1848 and 1849,) could hardly fail
to extract everything of value. It remains now to
explore the auriferous quartz veins which may extend
to the centre of the Sierra Nevada. This new
work, however, requires large capital, and extensive
combinations. The success of such operations
has hitherto been but moderate.</p>

<p>The auriferous richness of the quartz rocks in
California appears sufficient to remunerate the
speculator; and foreign capital is not deficient at
St. Francisco. Whence is it, then, that the quartz
mines have hitherto been but slightly attractive?
It has arisen from the want of the requisite and
essential conditions for the progress of such
undertakings.</p>

<p>Property in “placers” or in mines is not yet sufficiently
secure; it is neither yet placed fully
under the safeguard of law, nor is it protected by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
police regulations. Anarchy still reigns in this new
country;&mdash;not only have the miners to defend their
persons and their acquisitions against the incursions
from Indian tribes; not only are crimes and offences
common (lynch law maintaining a permitted existence
instead of laws and police); but every one
appears to hold his property by right of first comer:
a miner chooses the spot he likes best; a strong arm
and a carbine, with a steady eye, are his title
deeds. To seize upon a rich “placer” from a miner
too weak to resist, is called in the slang of the
district, to “jump a claim.” The President of the
United States himself, stated in his last message,
that “The mineral lands should remain free to
every citizen;” and the Secretary of State has
added, “that the right of occupancy should be submitted
only to such laws as the miners themselves
thought fit to make.”</p>

<p>The continuous flow of emigration, and the continuous
working of the gold districts, appear to
indicate, that in spite of many reverses and sufferings,
the mass of emigrants consider the result as
likely to be profitable. Without approaching to
the fabulous accounts of the early adventurers, these
results have certainly largely exceeded in magnificence
those of any former period in history; let
us endeavour to particularize some of them.</p>

<p>Mr. Butler King, in his report to the Secretary
of State, in 1850, after a careful examination of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
California, values the washings and gold working
of the two years, 1848 and 1849, at <a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>40,000,000
dollars. The basis of this calculation, the first
officially presented, was a produce of 1000 dollars
(<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>5350 francs) per miner, per annum.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Butler King, American emigration
hardly began to flow towards California until
September, 1849; up to that period, foreigners,
principally from Mexico and Oregon, had reaped
all the profit of the washings. The <i>San Francisco
Herald</i> estimated, that at the end of 1850, the gold
produce of California, for the twenty-one months
between 1 April, 1849, and 31 December, 1850, at
the sum of 68,587,591 dollars (nearly <a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>367,000,000
francs). According to the documents published in
France by the Minister of Commerce, which appear
to have been derived from local statistics, the
produce was rather less than the above. From
1 April, 1849, to 31 March, 1851, in two years, it
was raised to <a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>329,000,000 francs.</p>

<p>Monsieur Emilie Chevalier, who has just returned
from a government mission to Panama, in a report
to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, considers the
result as having been much larger. The gold
brought as freight by steamers in 1850, he estimates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
at <a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>50,306,525 dollars. The author of the report
adds, on the testimony of a person whom he
considers as competent to give a sound opinion,
that the sums carried by passengers are not less
than three fourths of the amounts brought as
merchandize; and thus he arrives at the extraordinary
figures of 88,000,000 dollars (more than
<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>470,000,000 francs) for a single year. At St. Francisco,
where they are able to form probably a
more correct estimate on a subject so difficult to
trace accurately, they do not value the amount of
gold carried by passengers at above one-fourth the
amount taken in freight. Even on this supposition
there will be a sum of 25,000,000 dollars, or
above <a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>133,000,000 francs to be deducted; but it
appears to me very doubtful, if the produce of
1850 exceeded this figure of <a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>329,000,000 francs,
according to the French documents already referred
to. We have more valuable documents of another
kind to rely upon, in the quantities of gold coined
at the United States’ Mint; the following are the
official figures:&mdash;</p>

<p>All the gold sent to the Mint did not, however,
come from California. A part consisted of specie
sent from Europe, in exchange for American stocks
or merchandize. The treasure found in 1848 in
the Valley of the Sacramento, belonged, as it has
been stated, principally to foreigners. Up to the
month of March, 1850, the United States’ Mints had
not received above 11,000,000 or <a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>12,000,000 dollars
of Californian gold. At the end of August in that
year the amounts paid in did not exceed <a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>24,500,000
dollars. A year later, the mints had received in
gold from that source <a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>80,000,000 dollars.</p>

<p>The United States have naturally sent the larger
number of the emigrants to California. It is with the
United States principally that the trade is carried
on. It would appear, then, to be natural that the
principal flow of gold from the Sierra Nevada should
take that direction. Doubtless a portion of the gold
found annually in California will remain there,
and form the circulating medium. Considerable
amounts also will have been spread throughout
South America, and amongst the various commercial
countries of Europe, either in payment of goods
shipped, or as the free capital arising from the
accumulations of labor. I shall not be exaggerating,
however, in supposing, that seven-tenths of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
gold annually produced is coined in the United
States, and that one-tenth of the produce only is
shipped directly to Europe. Thus, then, the
United States having received from California
<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>100,000,000 dollars up to the end of 1850, the
total produce of the four years, including 1848,
(during which year there did not appear to have
been any coinage from Californian gold), ought to
have been from <a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>750,000,000 to <a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>800,000,000 francs.</p>

<p>The gold exported from California in 1851 is
estimated by the Custom House returns at
<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>56,000,000 dollars. According to the calculations of
the <i>St. Francisco Herald</i>, for the first three months
of 1852, the total produce amounted to <a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>14,656,142
dollars; at this rate the produce of the year 1852
would not be less than <a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>62,000,000 dollars. The
export of April is estimated at St. Francisco, at
<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>3,422,000 dollars, rather more than <a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>18,000,000
francs. The produce of the “placers,” according to
the latest reports, although still abundant, is decreasing;
nevertheless, if Australia does not attract
the most experienced and the most greedy of the
work-people, the mines of California appear likely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
to yield this year not less than about <a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>300,000,000
of our money; that is six times the amount of the
production of gold at the beginning of the century,
throughout the civilized world. It is twice the
amount of the production of gold in 1847. It is
hardly needful to exaggerate these figures, as many
writers on both sides of the Atlantic have already
done, in order to prove that a change is occurring in
our monetary values, and that the <i>status quo</i> which
has lasted for above half a century, is not necessarily
to continue for ever.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2>V.</h2>

<p>Of the three great gold-producing countries of
modern times, New South Wales is the one now
most attracting public attention. This country enjoys
several advantages over the others.</p>

<p>The climate is mild and healthy, the land is
neither occupied by savage tribes nor infested with
wild beasts. In a country where drought is the principal
obstacle to successful cultivation, the gold regions,
situated on the slopes of the highest mountains
and near the sources of the principal streams, are
naturally the best watered. They appear to extend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
from north-east to south-west, following the direction
of the Murray, the largest river in Australia,
and over an extent of 1,400 miles, <a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>(2,452 kilomêtres)
by 400 miles (643 kilomêtres). This surface is
larger, by four times, the extent of California, and
five times larger than Great Britain.</p>

<p>The effects of the Californian gold have been principally
felt at a distance from the producing country.
The valleys of San Joaquim and the Sacramento
were, before the extraordinary discoveries of 1847,
but a desert, with but an occasional “oasis” of cultivation;
California had neither population, agriculture,
commerce, or industry. The “rancheros,”
half farmers, half hunters, raised cattle for no other
purpose than for the value of their hides; the discovery
of gold could hardly disturb any existing
trade. The production itself was then the cause or
the motive power, creating a new state of society,
a new order of things.</p>

<p>In Australia, on the contrary, and long before the
consequences of the discoveries could be appreciated
in Europe, the working of the mines was of itself a
revolution. The first washings occurred in May,
1851; at that time the English colonists in that
part of the world were in a flourishing position.
The population of European origin did not exceed
400,000 in the whole Australian group of islands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
New South Wales, in which division Victoria was
included, recently elevated into a separate colony,
numbered more than two-thirds of this total, and
formed the chief seat of its industry and wealth.
The inhabitants, principally the descendants of
convicts of the last century, obtained, in 1850, a
representative form of government, and now make
their own laws. They have upwards of fifty-one
newspapers, and they have also public schools and
banks. Their principal harbours are on a large
scale, and the inter-communication by steam-boats
and roads excellent. Their principal cities are
Sydney, with its 50,000; and Melbourne, with its
35,000 inhabitants, which are lighted with gas, and
have an organized police, as in London.</p>

<p>The luxury of living and of dress defies comparison,
and affords large profits to tradesmen; they
have already begun to make two railroads. Australia
has its commercial fleet, which entered into
competition for the supply of flour to California
in 1850. The trade with England is of twice the
magnitude to that which existed between England
and her American colonies at the time of their
separation. The colonial revenue, exclusive of the
sale of the Crown lands, which forms the foundation
of the emigration fund, nearly amounts to
£1,000,000 sterling, per annum.</p>

<p>Australia produces wheat, Indian corn, and barley,
in abundance; they have planted vines, from which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
they are making good wine; tobacco is successfully
and extensively cultivated; but the principal source
of wealth is derived from the growth of wool, for
the production of which the lands watered by the
tributaries of the Murray are as well adapted
as the valley of the Mississippi is for the production
of cotton. Australia takes a prominent position
with respect to civilization, in the midst of the pastoral
employment of her population. It is a vast
arcadia, the poetical side being cast into shade by
the industrial occupation of its inhabitants, and perhaps
somewhat damaged by a very natural corruption
of morals. It has been called a mine of wool
and tallow; 20,000,000 of sheep are said to be
pastured on its plains. In England the use of
Australian wool has almost entirely superseded that
of Germany and Spain, and the Yorkshire manufacturers
cannot now dispense with it. In 1850
Australia exported 137,000 bales, and in 1851,
130,000; 130,000 bales are worth about <a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>65,000,000
francs. The mother country receives, then, from
Australia about £3,000,000 sterling of raw material
in exchange for £3,000,000 of English manufactures;
the result is most profitable for capital and
labor; it is to this beneficial and flourishing trade
that the sudden appearance of gold has threatened
a most unexpected and alarming interruption.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Roderick Murchison, whose opinions are considered
as of high authority, commenting on the
writings of Count Strelecki on the geology of New
South Wales, announced, in the year 1845, that gold
would be found in the sides of those great chains
of hills, which may be called their Alps or their
Pyrennees. At different times, fragments of the precious
metal had been brought either to Sydney, or to
Melbourne, without having excited the belief in the
minds of the public that they were really the product
of their own soil. In the month of March, 1851, a
person, less incredulous than his neighbours, a Mr.
Hargraves, struck with the similarity of the geological
features of the country to California, whence
he had lately arrived, made up his mind that gold
must be to be found in New South Wales, and set
himself resolutely to work to hunt for it at the foot
of the mountains, and in the beds of the adjacent
rivers. Having found some small portions, he
followed the pursuit until he had satisfied himself
of the existence of gold in a great number of places.
He then went to Bathurst, an advanced post in the
country, called a public meeting, openly announced
his discovery; and in order to give practical proof,
took many of his hearers to the seat of his own
exploits, in a little valley at the foot of Mount
Sumner, where he employed nine miners to dig
actively, and to wash the earth. Four ounces
of the purest gold were brought to light, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
produce of three days’ labor; each man had gained
£2 4s. 4d. (61 francs) per diem; but this was
not considered by Mr. Hargraves as above the
half of the probable gain to be obtained by an
experienced workman, and with proper implements.</p>

<p>This happened on the 8th May, 1851. The result
of the experiment was immediately blazoned forth:
three persons started for the washings, and returned
in a few days with several pounds of gold. At the
same time a geologist, ordered by the local government
to attest the statements of Mr. Hargraves, at
once stamped an official authority on the actual
existence of gold mines. This news created an immense
sensation, not only in Bathurst, but beyond,
and in the capital of the colony. On the 19th May,
there were 600 miners at the “<i>placers</i>;” an enormous
immigration to a district where the population
was but thinly scattered over an almost indefinite
extent of land. On the 24th, some of the people
wrote to their friends, that they were collecting
from £3 to £4 per day. One party of four miners
had in one day, obtained thirty ounces of gold,
and had found a “nugget” weighing one pound.
In three weeks time, one workman alone amassed
£1,600 sterling.</p>

<p>We would remark, in running hastily over the
account of these early experiments, that from the
first, the inhabitants of Australia foresaw the serious
consequences of the revolution about to occur. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
colonial journals were filled with lamentations and
direful forebodings, and cursed, both in prose and
in verse, the mania for gold. The solitude of the
towns, at the expense of which the deserts were
peopled, the abandonment of labour, the disruption
of all social ties, flocks left without shepherds,
and crops destroyed for lack of harvestmen:
in short, every kind of misfortune from which the
colonies are now suffering, were seen in perspective.
The greediest seekers for gold might well take
alarm; the epidemic, however, stopped not, and soon
spread in all directions. The Government took the
lead, by largely rewarding Mr. Hargraves, and appointing
him the “explorer of the mineral districts.”
A proclamation immediately appeared, claiming
the precious discoveries as Crown property, and
announcing a rate of license for working gold
mines at 30s. per miner per month. A wild spirit of
speculation soon sprang up in every direction.
The municipal authorities everywhere followed the
example of the Government. From the Bay of
Newton to the Gulph of St. Vincent, over an extent
of 2,000 miles of shore, there was no town or village
without its sought-for neighbouring “placers.”
In many districts, associations were immediately
formed, offering premiums for the earliest discovery
of gold.</p>

<p>The locality of the first operations was situated
at the junction of two little valleys, whose water-courses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
fell into the River Macquarie, a tributary of
the Murray, and which soon received the scriptural
name of Ophir. The early successful workings in
these “placers” were soon cast into shade by the
more brilliant result of the works on the Turon,
and its tributaries; here gold was found not only in
scales, but in pépites or nuggets. Whilst the Ophir
digger was making his 15s. or 20s. on an average
day’s work, the people at Turon were counting their
gains by ounces. The more primitive process of
washing had given way to the more philosophical
system by amalgamation. The operation was sufficiently
remunerative to repay a simple mechanic at
the rate of 20s. a day in addition to his keep; but
the miners no sooner obtained money enough to
buy a license, and some implements, but they set to
work in a more business-like manner. They formed
themselves into parties of three or six, the day’s
work of each party sometimes producing several
ounces of gold. The weight of the pépites varied
from one-fifth of an ounce to many ounces.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of July, Doctor Ker found
in the valley of Meroo, a few miles from Wellington,
a lump of quartz weighing 3 cwt., containing
more than 100 pounds of gold. Later, again, they
found three “nuggets,” each weighing from 26 to
28 pounds. In the month of August, the export to
England commenced; the first remittances of gold
dust amounted to £50,000 sterling. The washings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
at the Turon and Mount Ophir were then producing
£10,000 to £12,000 sterling per week.</p>

<p>The treasure of Doctor Ker, exhibited first at
Bathurst and then at Sydney, soon drove everybody
wild. The very newspapers which had first maligned
the discovery, now sounded the trumpet in
praise of this wonderful piece of good fortune.
“The news,” says the <i>Morning Herald</i> of Sydney,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
“will astonish Australia, will astonish England,
Ireland, and Scotland, will astonish California, and
will astonish the whole world. On the arrival of
the packet in England, when every newspaper
throughout the United Kingdom shall have repeated
the news of the discovery as the wonder of our age,
the sensation will be profound, and will exceed
anything hitherto talked of, or thought of; from
the queen on the throne to the peasant in the
fields, there will be but one united exclamation of
surprise and astonishment; from the palace to the
cottage, from the drawing-room to the stable, from
the schoolboy to the philosopher and the statesman,
there will be one universal talk of this mass
of gold, and of the country whence it came; from
all the ports in Great Britain and Ireland, ships
will be freighted with passengers and goods&mdash;population
and wealth will rush to Australia like a torrent.
Port Jackson will be the best filled and the
most flourishing harbour in the world, and Sydney
will take its rank amongst the most opulent cities.
New South Wales will be looked upon in England
as the queen of her colonies.”</p>

<p>Waiting the impression to be produced in the
mother country by the news of the “golden land,”
to use again the expression of the <i>Morning Herald</i>,
the population of Sydney flocked to the diggings;
the numbers who left were about 400 a day. Sailors
deserted their ships in the harbours. Government,
on account of the dearness of provisions, doubled
the salaries of their officials. In every direction
there was a general hunt in quest of new “placers;”
and the districts South and West of Sydney were
explored by miners to the extent of 200 miles.
Auriferous deposits were discovered in the counties
of St. Vincent, Argyle, Dampier, Wallace, and
Wellesley, as well as in the basins of Murrumbedgee
Shoalhaven, the River Hume, the River Peel, and
the Snow River. At the extreme north of New
South Wales, in the district of Moreton Bay, the
diggings are in full work at the several branches of
the River Condamine. Nearer to the capital, in
New England, gold has been found in abundance in
the basin of the River Macdonald. 200 miles south
of Sydney, at Braidwood, one miner realized £30
sterling in five weeks; another £42 sterling in fifteen
days; and a party of three £200 sterling in one
week. Nothing was more common than a produce
of two ounces per man per day; and not unfrequently
it reached as much as one pound. Women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
also set to work. One widow and her two daughters
are said to have collected an average of two ounces
a-day.</p>

<p>The district of Turon did not lose its repute.
Such was the attraction for gold hunting, that a
labourer at Meroo would not undertake to work for
hire at a lower rate than £3 a-week, in addition to
his food. Up to October, 1851, the Government
had given out 8,637 licenses; 10,000 miners were
at work in the province of Sydney, and £215,866
sterling, (about 5,500,000 francs) had already been
shipped to England.</p>

<p>In December, the yield of the “placers” averaged
£40,000 sterling per week, a sum equivalent, after
deducting the stoppages during extreme drought
and rain, to £2,000,000 sterling per annum.</p>

<p>These results, however brilliant they appeared,
were soon eclipsed by the accounts from the
province of Victoria. Gold was first discovered at
Ballarat, where it was found at some considerable
depth from the surface; then at Mount Alexander,
where it was dug up merely by the pickaxe, almost
on the ground; at Caliban, fifteen miles further,
at Albany, on the Murray, and on the east coast at
Gipp’s Land.</p>

<p>It is asserted that the chain of hills which
separates the province of Victoria from Sydney,
and which are known by the name of the Snowy
Mountains, is one vast mine of gold. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
day announces some new discovery, and that of
yesterday is almost always surpassed by that of
to-day. The mines of Mount Alexander are in
extent about ten miles, and the earth is said to be
full of gold; they find the precious metal in a
gravelly clay, and in the interstices of a slatey
formation. It is sufficient to dig six inches of
soil; and already, in the month of December, 1851,
there were 15,000 miners at work, and the deposits
appeared inexhaustible.</p>

<p>Here occurred the most extraordinary events.
Amongst ordinary cases, seven workmen were
cited, who amassed 500 ounces of gold in three
weeks, which at £3 sterling per ounce, the then
current value of gold in the colony, was about <a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>260
francs per day each; at another time, two miners,
in the same space of time, collected 400 ounces, or
<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>735 francs per day each. One carman, who had
never even removed the earth, made up a bag of
£1,500 sterling in five weeks. A convict, but just
freed, made £150 sterling in sixteen days. A workman,
who had never exercised any trade but that
of shoeing horses, was somewhat less fortunate, but
brought home £100 sterling, clear, after paying
all expenses, and working five weeks. A boy of
fourteen, in less time, collected £400 sterling; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
another of the same age, £120 sterling; but the
ambition of the workmen knew no bounds; there
was scarcely a man who set to work digging a hole
who did not expect to come home at night with
£40 or £50. These expectations were kept up
by some most wonderful instances of fortune, the
recital of which, repeated from group to group,
amongst the diggers, soon became matters of history.
One spot of a few feet square produced <a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>45,000 fr.;
four sailors, after six weeks’ work, loaded their cart
with a case containing two hundred pounds of gold,
about <a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>260,000 francs; four other workmen, after
two months’ labour, divided <a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>1,000,000 francs. One
workman was spoken of who gathered twenty-five
pounds in two or three weeks, and another was
known to have amassed eleven pounds in forty-eight
hours; another, in less than one hour, made
up a package weighing thirty pounds, worth at
least <a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>38,000 francs. It was said that the miners
would no longer pick up gold-dust, it was not
worth while; anything smaller than a pin’s head
was thrown aside as too insignificant for notice.
There must have been fine gleanings from these
fastidious reapers.</p>

<p>In the “placers” of Mount Ophir, and of the
Turon, where the profits and the workings were on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
a more moderate scale, there was less difficulty in
preserving order and good behaviour. Captain
Erskine, of the Royal Navy, who was there about
the end of July, 1851, reports most favourably in
this respect. The miners received him with the
most perfect civility; order and good feeling was
the general rule. Captain Erskine only saw one
man drunk on the placers. The sale of spirituous
liquors was forbidden, and the Sundays religiously
observed. There even appeared some traces of
regular industry. The neighbouring “placers” of
Port Philip presented a perfectly different scene.
There, mining appeared to be considered as a complete
lottery. The coolest heads soon grew as wild
as the steadiest&mdash;passions and extravagance broke
loose in all directions. The consumption of wine,
beer, and spirituous liquors was enormous; gambling
tables, quarrels, and prize fighting, desecrated the
Sundays. One man was quoted who placed a £5
note between two pieces of bread and butter, and
ate it as a sandwich. Another rolled up two £5
Bank notes, and swallowed them as a pill. A
third went into a pastry cook’s shop to eat a cake,
threw down a Bank note, and refused to take up
the change. The miners appeared to have no idea
of the value of money; they bore their losses with
the most perfect philosophy. One man, who had
had a draft of <a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>3760 francs stolen from him, and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
enquiring at the bank, finding it had been already
cashed, exclaimed, “Bah! there is no want of
money now.”</p>

<p>A “<i>placer</i>” in the colony of Victoria presented
the appearance of an immense encampment, with
thousands of tents of all sizes, colours, and shapes;
the bivouac during the night was illuminated with
fires in all directions, and noisy with the discharge
of guns and pistols; every miner was armed to
the teeth, and could only trust to himself for the
protection of his booty and his life; every one kept
himself on the <i>qui vive</i>, and took even the precaution
of daily discharging and reloading his firearms
every evening at sunset. Government offered a
weekly transport to Melbourne at a charge of 1 per
cent.; but as, notwithstanding so exorbitant a charge,
this transport was without any guarantee against
robbery, the miners formed themselves into parties,
when tired with making their fortunes, and escorted
their own treasures. The bandits from Van Dieman’s
Land came down like birds of prey, and fell upon
the miners, and in such numbers and with such
fury, that when a murder was committed the local
police were not unfrequently afraid to go amongst
them to seize the murderer. The authorities of
Melbourne were unable to give effectual aid under
such circumstances; for their own city police,
with the exception of six, had all gone off to
the diggings. A cry of despair and indignation was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
universally raised. “The imbecility of our Government,”
says the <i>Argus</i>, “has compelled us to take
the police into our own hands, and to make lynch
law the rule of action.” The <i>Morning Herald</i> says,
“The Government must act with energy, and without
loss of time, or we shall become a second
California, with mutiny and lynch law established,
and crime in its naked deformity.” The Governor,
Sir G. Fitzroy, responded to this appeal by sending
home for more troops, and by recruiting his police
by discharged soldiers. Will it be sufficient for the
preservation of this community, scarcely yet formed,
from the threatened danger of disorganization, to
send a vessel of war to the station of Port Jackson,
and to Port Philip, and to reinforce the garrisons of
Australia, as Sir John Packington proposes, with
some 400 or 500 soldiers?</p>

<p>Fortunately, such a state of disorder is not likely
to become chronic; when public authority, which
ought to suppress it, is declared incompetent, society,
alarmed for its own existence, steps in and at all
hazard gets rid of turbulent characters. What is
to be as much feared, especially in a community of
such recent formation, is the attraction to a spirit
of gambling, from fortunes thus suddenly acquired.
Men, fascinated by such a magnet, abandon all productive
and useful employment. Neither their
ordinary vocations or their known duties will retain
them in their ordinary habits; no rates of pay can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
follow the progressive chances of the miner with his
pickaxe; the trade of gold-seeking supplants every
other occupation; a whole people are bowed
down to the earth, and absorbed in a work which
brutalizes them, and they abandon to others all the
cares of and attention to the cultivation of the soil.</p>

<p>From the beginning of November last, the towns
of Melbourne and Geelong were forsaken. Out
of this numerous population the women alone remained
stationary. The proximity of the “placers”
at two or three days’ journey rendered the access
easy. It was not necessary, as at Sydney, to
equip for a long journey, or to lay in a stock of provisions
and money. Men deserted, in crowds, flocks,
farms, ships, workshops, counting-houses, and shops;
no wages would induce them to remain. They
flocked in from Sydney, Van Dieman’s Land,
South Australia, and even from California. Vessels
arriving could not discharge their cargoes for want
of hands; goods perished on the quays, where they
had been piled up. In many districts of the
colony business and cultivation were suspended;
hands were wanted everywhere. When shearers
were to be met with, they asked the enormous price
of 3s. 6d. for twenty fleeces. A month later, and
Adelaide, the capital of Australia, realized the
picture of the “Deserted Village.” Traders, artizans,
proprietors, and capitalists, all were either ruined
or had emigrated to Port Philip, to escape from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
inevitable ruin. The shares in the celebrated
Burra Burra Copper Mine, which had been sold for
above £200, found no buyers at £60, and their 700
workmen had disappeared; prices of all goods and
wages rose in a frightful degree.</p>

<p>We read, in a letter from Melbourne, of the
17th January, 1852:&mdash;“In the Banks and at the
Post Offices, the clerks work double tides; other
public services are at a stand for want of hands.
There are no male servants to be found, even at
exorbitant wages, and women will not remain, unless
at considerable increase of pay. I requested
first the waiter, and then the maid, at the hotel
where I was stopping, to send a small parcel of
linen to be washed. They told me that they could
find no one who would wash. I was obliged to
go to a shop and buy some new things. If you
want a pair of boots, you must pay £2 10s. (63
francs). A pair of shoes cost 20s. (25 francs).”</p>

<p>Another letter, of the 1st January, adds again to
the picture:&mdash;“In my opinion, this town is threatened
with complete ruin. Last night, two men
arrived, announcing a discovery of gold deposits
in the district of Gipp’s Land; they had brought
£10,000 sterling in gold, and said there was enough
there for all the world. What shall we do for want
of labor? Suppose that 100,000 immigrants were
to arrive here next year, would one of them remain
in the towns or at the farms, earning a few shillings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
per week, when they can go to the diggings and
gather £50 in one day? At this very moment I
cannot find one man in Melbourne who can mend a
pair of boots at any price. I get bread from Collingwood,
as a great favor, and the baker will not
engage to supply me regularly. I pay 5s. for two
buckets of water, and 30s. for as much wood as
a horse can carry. One can hardly find a man
with a handbarrow to carry a portmanteau, even at
any price he chooses to ask. The servants of the
Judge have all left him, and he cannot use his carriage;
his sons clean the knives and shoes, and
drag their invalid father to the court in a wheel
chair.”</p>

<p>An inhabitant of Melbourne, himself reduced to
the necessity of looking after his horse, whilst his
wife attended to cooking the dinner, writes:&mdash;“One
of the members of our club, a large sheep-owner,
and who cannot obtain shearers, is gone to the
diggings to try and hire some men. He asked them
what wages he should pay them, they replied that
they must have all the wool; and, as he was leaving
them, they called him back to say. ‘We are in want
of a cook; we will give you £1 a day if you like
to take the place yourself.’”</p>

<p>At the “placers,” a mechanic is worth at least £1
a day. The people who return to the towns with
their little fortunes will no longer work, and consider
that they have a right to live on in idleness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
All provisions are dear. At Mount Alexander,
flour was sold at 5d. a pound (which is equal to
<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>60 centimes the demi-kilo.); oats at 18s. the
bushel, or <a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>64 francs the <a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>hectolitre. In August
last, wheat was not higher than 3d. a pound, and
oats 4s. the bushel, in the Sydney market, a higher
price than in any famine year in the European
markets.</p>

<p>Two causes have been acting simultaneously in
creating this great rise in the price of all the
necessaries of life, in those countries where the
gold finders have become suddenly enriched by the
discoveries of these “placers.” In the first place,
population increasing more rapidly than the supply
of food, has necessarily caused a rise in price, and
this consequent increase in price, is out of all proportion
to the deficiency of supply. Who does not
know that a deficiency of one-sixth, or even of
one-tenth of the crop of grain, frequently doubles,
or even trebles, the price during the famine. Such
was the case in France and England in 1846; and
without facilities of communication, and the cheapness
of carriage, the result, even at that period,
would have been much more calamitous. Can we
be astonished, then, that in a country where civilization
is but just established, where roads, canals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and railroads are wanting, the evils must be felt in
a greatly increased degree?</p>

<p>Another cause is the very abundance of the precious
metals. Gold, when amassed by handfuls,
instead of being collected in very small quantities,
and with great labour, must necessarily lose a
large part of its value. The diminution of the
price of gold and silver is, generally, only shewn by
the increase in the price of every other article.
The nominal value of the monetary sign remains
the same, but its power diminishes in proportion to
its increase in quantity, unless some counteracting
cause, such as an excessive supply of provisions,
&amp;c., should step in and re-establish the equilibrium.</p>

<p>Up to the present time, every progress in mining in
Australia is retarding the proper care and attention
to the breeding of cattle. Van Dieman’s Land,
which produced food for other districts of Australia,
is likely, it is said, to require an import of food for
her own people. It was true that the crops at
the end of 1851, presented every appearance of a
magnificent harvest, but how could a harvest be got
<i>in</i> on an island inadequately supplied with labour,
and where the people are deserting daily for other
places?</p>

<p>The position is certainly critical; with any other
people than those of Anglo-Saxon race, it might
be desperate: a few months more delay, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
wool shearing will be lost; for the flocks, no longer
watched, will have strayed away, and possibly will
have perished. It was the work of a quarter of a
century to have accumulated the capital employed
in Agriculture in Australia; without an immense
immigration, not of gold seekers, but of shepherds,
and persons accustomed to a pastoral life, before the
end of 1852 all this capital will be inevitably destroyed.
England has awakened rather late to the
danger, but she has now to work in good earnest to
apply the remedy. The Governor of Australia witnessed
the daily arrivals of emigrants with alarm, so
long as they added only to the crowds of miners, and
who by their competition still further increased the
price of provisions; he even pressed the Colonial
Secretary to try and turn the stream of emigration
to other colonies. But independent of Government
emigration, voluntary associations for the same object
have not been inactive. Liverpool alone has been
shipping at the rate of 2,000 a month for Sydney
or Melbourne. Ships are wanting in all the ports of
Great Britain and Ireland, for the transport of emigrants.
Shipbuilding yards are all in the greatest
state of active employment.</p>

<p>Nor has this want of an agricultural population
in Australia been overlooked. The islands to the
north and west and the Highlands of Scotland, contain
a population far too numerous for their means of
adequate support, so that in spite of hard and constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
work, there is frequent mortality from famine
in this poor and barren country. Twenty or thirty
thousand of these labourers, engaged for agricultural
occupations in Van Dieman’s Land, and for sheep
tending in New South Wales, would cease to be a
burthen on English charity, and would avert the
ruin of Australia. Subscription lists are opened
in England for this object, and the colony itself is
in a position to lend its aid, as Sir John Packington
informed Sir G. Fitzroy that the government would
place at the disposal of the local legislature the
revenues which might accrue from the workings
of these gold regions. At this time the port of
London contains a fleet of vessels ready to sail for
Australia, capable of conveying 23,000 persons and
30,000 tons of merchandize. It is clear, that by
abandoning all the rights of the Crown to the
treasures of the “placers,” the British Government
has saved Australia. By this arrangement, the
Colonial revenues have been almost doubled; 30s.
a month levied on 60,000 miners, working eight
months in the year, would produce <a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>18,000,000
francs. A tax of 60s. which was attempted to be
established, but which the miners resisted, might
have produced <a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>36,000,000 francs. In default of
English labourers, the expenses of whose voyage
must necessarily be great, and whose willingness to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
work could not be depended on, there would be
funds enough to import a whole population of
Indians or Chinese.</p>

<p>The production of these gold regions in Australia
does not appear to have exceeded £1,500,000 sterling
in 1851, from all the “placers” then worked;
but we know that the working in the province
of Sydney did not begin until the middle of
May; and in Victoria, not until the end of September.
In January, 1852, they reckoned 10,000
miners in the Sydney gold districts, the produce
of which oscillated between 12,000 and 15,000
ounces per week. For eight month’s work this
would give about <a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>31,000,000 francs at the Colonial
price, and <a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>35,000,000 at the English price
of gold; but the population will certainly have
increased in 1852, and it will be a moderate
calculation to estimate the produce of this province
at <a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>40,000,000 to 50,000,000 francs during
this year.</p>

<p>In the province of Victoria, 30,000 miners were at
work at the “placers,” at the end of December; and
the number was daily increasing. They probably
would have received, by the spring of this year, a
reinforcement of 10,000. Mineral working is a lottery,
in which very few gain the great prizes. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
letter from Sydney, dated 4th February, thus sums
up the result of the work, and of its uncertainty and
irregularity. “They calculate, that out of every
ten speculators who hire workmen for the gold-washings,
only one repays his expenses, and of those
who work on their own account, the proportion who
are successful is about one in five.” It is not to be
expected, then, that the quantity of gold collected
by so many miners should equal the brilliant, the
extraordinary, profits made by many of the first
adventurers. It is a liberal calculation to suppose
that the 40,000 miners of the province of Victoria
might obtain on an average 10s. or 12s. each for
their daily work. At 200 days’ work this could
give about <a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>3,000 francs each, or about 120,000,000
francs per annum. Thus, these two provinces
would yield a produce in 1852, of <a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>40,000,000 for
Sydney, and <a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>120,000,000 for Victoria, together
about <a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>160,000,000 francs.</p>

<p>In following the scale of progress of California,
these results might be doubled the third year: but
it should be remarked, that up to March last, notwithstanding
the immense increase of the workings
carried on for nearly a year in Sydney, and for
six months in Australia-Felix, the colony had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
shipped, of all the gold it had collected, above
£819,000 sterling (20,537,000 francs) to England.</p>

<p>Uniting the products of the three great gold
regions, we find that Siberia, California, and Australia,
are expected to supply in 1852, about
<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>600,000,000 francs: a mass of gold equal to about
175 tons in weight. It should be borne in mind,
that China and Japan have also their mines of gold
and silver in full work; the produce of which does
not appear, however, to leave those countries. The
Chain of the Himalaya possibly contains mineral
wealth equal to that of the Cordilleras, the dorsal
division of South America, from Chili to Oregon.
It is also said, that the inhabitants of Thibet have
begun to work their golden alluvial deposits. All
the mines in the world, therefore, are not yet fully
worked; and there will, probably, be an ample
supply for some generations to come. The gold supplied
by America, independently of California, can
hardly be estimated at above <a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>8,000 kilogrammes
per annum. Hungary is the only country in Europe,
excepting Russia, which is producing about <a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>2,000
kilogrammes of gold. The quantity from Africa is
very small; and <a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>3,000 or 4,000 kilogrammes is the
whole of the known produce of the washings in the
Straits of Sunda, and in the peninsula of Malacca.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
From all which sources united, an approximative
value may be fixed at from <a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>40,000,000 to 50,000,000
francs. To sum up the whole, then, it would appear
that the gold production of 1852 may be estimated
at&mdash;</p>

<p>It has been already stated, that California produced
<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>750,000,000 francs during the four years 1848 to
1851. Russia, during the same period, at the rate of
<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>100,000,000 fr., will have produced <a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>400,000,000,
and the other gold districts <a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>200,000,000. Thus, in
the five years ending with 1852, the total production
including Australia, will probably amount to nearly
<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>two milliards of francs: a result unexampled in
history; gold has never previously flowed from
such numerous channels, and from such abundant
sources.</p>

<h2>VI.</h2>

<p>What will be the effects produced by this
expansion of gold on those countries where the
discoveries and working have occurred, and on
the great centres of wealth and industry, where
competition is in active operation, and where
the gold may, when in the shape of coin, fix a
new value on commodities? First, as regards
the gold-producing countries themselves. It is
clear that the attraction to the “diggings” must
retard, if not put a temporary stop, to really productive
labour, that of the cultivation of the land:
but this demoralizing influence may not be of long
duration. The “placers” will become exhausted,
the gold of alluvial deposit, that which the rains
and other causes have spread over the surface of
the soil, has hitherto been the chief feeder of the
supply. The thousands of miners working at the
various sources, and turning over and over again
every part of the surface, will soon have picked out
every particle of the metal. The remainder of
the gold must then be sought for in the quartz;
whence it can be obtained only by the aid of scientific
processes, and effectually extracted only by the
application of capital: which is hardly likely to be
supplied to an adequate extent, excepting by companies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
in the same way as has been the case in
the working of silver mines. Then individual
enterprize will be again directed to the cultivation
of the soil. Out of the crowds of emigrants
in Australia and California, now attracted to the
“diggings,” the number required for agricultural
purposes will no longer be deficient. Amongst the
adventurers who are expatriating themselves to seek
fortunes in new countries, there will be numbers of
poor families who will consider themselves adequately
repaid by being able to obtain in a distant
land, a fair remuneration for their services, and the
ownership of land, with the means of a comfortable
livelihood.</p>

<p>The Spaniards, in the early days of conquest in
South America, began by abandoning all other
pursuits than the search of gold and silver; they
ended however, by building cities, forming harbours,
constructing churches, planting the land, and rearing
flocks. After the soldiers came the miners, after the
miners came the colonists: swords were turned into
plough-shares. That which occurred in the 17th
century will recur in the 19th. Australia, California,
and the colder regions of the Altai, will
be covered with people. It may readily be believed
that Providence, in the accumulation of treasures
like loadstones in the hearts of the mountains and
in the depths of the valleys, has contemplated the
attraction of a superabundant population, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the genius of colonization throughout the civilized
world.</p>

<p>Thus much for the producing country itself.
Let us now consider the effect of this superabundance
of gold on the importing countries. The first
and most important question is, whether the relative
proportions in value between gold and silver is
likely to be materially disturbed. We have been
considering the present production of gold, let us
now see how the case stands as regards silver.</p>

<p>Mons. de Humboldt estimates the amount of silver
annually produced at the commencement of this
century at 870,000 kilogrammes (about <a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>193,000,000
francs). In 1847, M. Michel Chevalier, considered
the annual production to be 775,000 kilogrammes,
(about <a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>172,000,000 francs), but there is reason
to suppose that this writer under-estimated the
returns of the Mexican mines, which he placed at
<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>18,500,000 piastres, and in a later work, the same
authority states the production at <a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>900,000 kilogrammes.
The English paper, <i>The Economist</i>, estimated
the return of 1850 at <a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>191,772,000 francs;
the actual production, however, appears to have
been much larger. It cannot be placed at a lower
figure than 1,000,000 of kilogrammes for 1851, or at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
about <a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>230,000,000 francs. The following is the

<p>We do not think we shall be exaggerating in
supposing that the production will have reached
<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>250,000,000 francs in 1852, and that it will consequently
have exceeded <a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>1,100,000 kilogrammes. At
this rate the accumulated value of the precious metals
produced in 1852 will have reached the figure of
<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>850,000,000 fr., of which silver will represent the
proportion of about 30 per cent; the weight of gold
will then be in the proportion of 1 to 6³⁄₁₀ to silver.</p>

<p>In estimating a gradual increase in the production
of silver, we have some data for our supposition.
In 1843, there was scarcely <a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>16,000,000 piastres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
from Mexico; in 1849, the silver coined at the Mexican
Mint amounted to <a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>20,000,000 dollars, without
reckoning that portion which escaped duty, and
which probably amounted to <a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>3,000,000 or 4,000,000
more; <a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>we are certainly quite within the mark,
it is even more probable that the production this
year may again reach the sum of <a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>27,000,000 dollars,
to which it had attained in 1805, under the
Spanish Government. In Chili the progress has
been still more rapid, the mines which in 1841 produced
<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>821,000 piastres, and in 1845, <a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>1,534,000,
having in 1849 given <a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>3,343,000, and in 1850
<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>4,070,000 piastres.</p>

<p>One cause of a purely local nature has contributed
to this result. It is known that the process of amalgamation
is almost the only one employed by the
miners in extracting the ores of Chili, Peru, and
Mexico. To obtain 1 cwt. of silver it is necessary
to employ 1½ cwt. of quicksilver; it is evident,
therefore, that the price of quicksilver must have
a great influence on the cost of extraction. When
it has become too dear, the working has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
confined to the richest mines; when it has fallen
the increase in the working of the poorer ores has
soon followed. Before the war of independence,
the Crown of Spain, preserving the monopoly of
the sale of quicksilver, gave it out at all their
depots in Mexico at <a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>35 to 40 piastres the cwt.;
thence arose the immense increase in the workings
of the silver mines, notwithstanding the coarseness
of the ores. Since the Spanish Government,
however, has, pressed by the miserable position
of its finances, farmed out the produce of the
Almaden mines, the lessees who had agreed to pay
a very heavy rent, and who had no competition to
fear for a long period of time, raised the price of
the quicksilver beyond all bounds. A few years
since the price at Guanaxuato rose to <a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>150 piastres
the cwt. In 1850 the agent of Messrs. Rothschild
fixed the price at <a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>103 piastres in Vera Cruz, and
at <a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>105 at the depot in Mexico. At the same date
the price was <a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>120 at Mazatlan. The cost price
of the quicksilver at Almaden is <a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>18 dollars the
cwt., and it is sold at the rate of <a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>45 dollars for
extraction of the ores in Spain.</p>

<p>The high price will cease with the monopoly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Spain has no longer the exclusive privilege of
furnishing quicksilver for the mines in the New
World. California possesses mines of cinnabar in
abundance, and they are now in full work. Those
of New-Almaden, situated at some leagues from San
Francisco, are now producing <a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>400 kilogrammes a
day. At 300 day’s work this could give a provision
of <a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>120,000 kilogrammes, sufficient to work
at least <a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>80,000 kilogrammes of silver. At the
mine itself this quicksilver is worth <a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>25 piastres
the cwt.; brought to Fresnillo, near the rich veins
of Sombrerete, and on the backs of mules from the
port of Mazatlan, it has been sold at <a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>93 piastres
in 1850. The proprietors of New-Almaden undertake
to reduce the price whenever the price of
Spanish quicksilver shall be lowered. They have
sent some of it to Chili, where silver-mine working
has taken a fresh start. They can sell it advantageously
in Peru, for the quicksilver of Huancavelica
cost at Pasco in August, 1850, <a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>104 piastres
the cwt. The mine of New Almaden is not the
only one being worked in California; cinnabar is
met with in several directions, and hereafter it is
probable that California may be looked to as a
country producing quicksilver as well as gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>The news of the discovery of quicksilver mines in
Mexico, in the neighbourhood of San Luis de Potosi,
was confirmed by accounts received in London in
March last. Are they old mines formerly abandoned
on account of their poverty, or have they really
discovered an ore which, as at New Almaden, yields
a produce of 50 per cent. of quicksilver? This is a
point yet to be cleared up. In the meantime the
price of silver has fallen in the district of Guanaxuato
to <a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>40 piastres the hundred weight, and it is
now varying between a price of <a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>55 and 56 piastres.
In short, one of the conditions connected with silver
mining has materially changed. An economy of
<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>60 or 70 piastres per hundred weight in the cost
of amalgamation can hardly fail to kindle a fresh
spirit of enterprize.</p>

<p>Another cause will necessarily act on the production
of silver, and that is the very abundance of gold.
When silver is found to be more in demand, fresh
activity will ensue, both in reopening old galleries,
which have been closed as not sufficiently remunerative,
and in pushing on the work in those actually
in operation. If the mines, feeding the present
supply, are becoming exhausted, and other sources
are not forthcoming, in a few years silver will reach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the price of gold, or the value of gold will descend to
that of silver; but as the limits of silver working are
but the price of labour, the power of machinery,
and the application of science, so, every increase in
the quantity of gold which is not caused by accidental
circumstances, or by an extraordinary demand,
must produce a corresponding increase in the production
of silver. Is not this a fact which we have
been witnessing since 1850? Who can venture to
affirm that Californian gold has had no influence in
stimulating the workings of silver in Mexico and
Chili? Besides this, the extraction of gold is generally
accompanied with a production of silver. Silver
mines are not always auriferous, and the richest in
gold contain but a small quantity of it, but gold mines
are almost always argentiferous. The proportion of
silver in a “nugget” of gold is about ⅛th in California,
¹⁄₁₀th in Siberia, and ⅕th in New South
Wales. So that for every <a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>four kilogrammes of gold
in Australia, there is about one of silver. This is
an important fact resulting from chemical analysis.</p>

<p>The production of silver is in the course of increase.
Will that of gold be kept up? It is
reasonable to entertain considerable doubt on this
point. In Siberia we have seen it retrograde since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
1847. The extraction appears stationary&mdash;perhaps
rather on the decrease in California. Australia
alone, with gold fields yet unexplored, appears
likely to produce much more than heretofore. Auriferous
strata may be discovered elsewhere, and add
to the general stock. Combining these various
circumstances, we incline to the opinion that the
quantities now forming the annual production of
gold will not be diminished for a certain number
of years; but when the miners have exhausted the
gatherings from the alluvial deposits, and it becomes
necessary to seek the golden ore in the rocks and
mountains, in which nature appears during the
various revolutions and convulsions of the world,
to have deposited it; then the working of the mines
will depend upon the amount of capital and the
degree of science, which may hereafter be brought
to bear on that description of enterprize.</p>

<p>In a paper read in 1848, before the Royal Institution
of London, Sir Roderick Murchison remarks
that the principal deposits of gold are found in
auriferous “detritus,” and that the same degree of
success must not be expected to ensue from exploring
the veins, which are ramified through the quartz
rock. The result hitherto shown in California fully
confirms this theory, as is shown in the following
letter from an engineer at St. Francisco, dated 4th
April last, after an expedition amongst the localities
occupied by the gold diggers:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“I send you the result of experiments made upon
fragments of rock. In each we have operated upon
three tons of quartz, reduced to powder, and carefully
worked by amalgamation. We have made
five experiments upon as many veins in the county
of Bath, which is situated between l’Yuba and the
River de la Plume. No. 1 has produced <a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>3 dollars
53 cents per ton; No. 2, <a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>9 dollars 50 cents; Nos.
3 and 4, <a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>11 dollars each; and No. 5, <a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>17 dollars.</p>

<p>“In the county of Nevada, experiments have
been made on four different points. The first has
given <a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>15 dollars per ton; the second, scarcely any
gold; the third, <a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>14 dollars per ton&mdash;this mine, upon
which a company had established works, has been
abandoned;&mdash;and the fourth has given <a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>59 dollars,
the vein being of an extraordinary richness, and
having yielded large returns to the proprietors.</p>

<p>“In the county of Eldorado, three different veins
did not give a larger return than <a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>17 dollars per ton;
a fourth equalled the richness of No. 4, in the
adjoining county.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>
<p>“In the county of Mariposa, out of eight experiments,
three veins gave hardly <a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>3 to 7 dollars per
ton; three more gave <a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>7 to 20 dollars; one gave <a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>24
dollars; and one more, <a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>38. The two last veins
have attracted miners, who are going to work
them. No enterprize requires a more careful and
a more expensive examination than an auriferous
quartz mine. A good vein, yielding <a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>36 dollars per
ton, may be considered, by moderate people, as
worth working; sometimes they are found much
richer; but out of all the quartz-crushing mills
which have been set up in California, I do not
think that one-third are used for mines which are
yielding, for any continued period, <a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>30 dollars the
ton; so that one-half of the works of this nature are
suspended.”</p>

<p>From the above account, it would appear that
a vein of quartz, to be considered productive, should
give 36 dollars, or <a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>192 francs per ton. This return
represents a weight of 55 grammes upon 1000
kilogrammes, or 5½ parts of gold out of 100,000
parts of quartz. Mineral of iron stone will give 10
to 15 of metal per 100; and the production by
melting is infinitely less troublesome or expensive
than the extraction of gold. In Australia, it was
at first supposed, after an analysis of some ounces
of quartz, taken from Mount Ophir, that the ton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
would yield more than £1100 sterling; but these
experiments, made on so small a scale, are of little
value. It is not likely that Australia, when the
miners find themselves reduced to the necessity of
working the quartz rocks, will show any considerable
increase of yield over California.</p>

<p>The extraordinary abundance of gold, then, does
not appear to be of permanent duration. It is a
sudden outbreak which we, accordingly, have to
meet. It does not appear to be, as far as we can
now form any opinion, a reign of one metal, which
is likely to take the place of some other; nevertheless,
there will most infallibly be a very marked fall
of gold in comparison with silver, unless met by a
most extraordinary activity in working the silver
mines; other causes, however, although secondary
in themselves, appear, concurrently, likely to neutralize
part of the effect of this superabundance.</p>

<p>It is of little importance to ascertain the amount
of the annual production of the precious metals,
unless we investigate the proportions in which they
are distributed between the two hemispheres. Silver
gives rise to a regular trade, and, coming from
sources long open, it is sent almost exclusively to
Europe, as an article of exchange, against the
produce of her soil, or of her industry. Gold in
California, on the contrary, a source of unexpected
wealth, starting up in a new country, is first absorbed
by the wants of a local circulation. A new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
society, formed in the midst of a desert country,
necessarily requires some medium of exchange: some
money. Next to the immediate necessities of California
come the wants of the United States. These
States have, for some years past, been endeavouring
to introduce a greater amount of the precious metals
into their monetary circulation. The gold of California
has powerfully contributed to effect this
object. Silver coin now circulates, but in small
amounts, throughout the Union. They have coined
gold pieces of 20, 10, 5, and even of one dollar.
Out of <a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>400,000,000 to 500,000,000 francs, brought
in during the three first years, not more than
<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>70,000,000 or 75,000,000 have found their way to
Europe. The import of 1851 has been more sensibly
felt. According to the returns of the American
newspapers, the quantity of gold shipped to Europe
from New York and New Orleans, was, during last
year, <a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>200,000,000 francs.</p>

<p>The like result is obtained from other channels of
information. The Mint of London, which ordinarily
coins gold at the rate of about £2,000,000 sterling
per annum; and which, in 1850, had not coined
more than £1,492,000 sterling; in 1851, increased
their operations to the extent of a coinage of
£4,200,000 sterling (above 105,000,000 of francs).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
The moiety of this gold must have come from California.
In the same year, the mint of Paris coined
in gold <a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>269,709,570 francs, of which about half
was supplied by the conversion of 100,000,000 of
Dutch Guillaumes into French money. In the
accounts of the German Mints, we find about
<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>200,000,000 of Californian gold. If we are to judge
from the operations of our own mint, the import of
1852 will be smaller than that of 1851; for we have
coined but 14,000,000 pieces in gold during the first
three months of this year.</p>

<p>Australia sends regularly large amounts of her
gold to England; but a part of the export of
gold dust, or “nuggets,” is returned in gold coin.
Many vessels have lately cleared from London
with £200,000 sterling; and this at a time when
England had barely received £800,000 sterling,
from Sydney and Melbourne. Considerable amounts
will likewise be imported in plate and jewellery.
The more wealth increases in the colony,
the more gold will be employed both for circulation
and for luxuries. The producing country
will be most certainly, <i>par excellence</i>, the country
of consumption. Europe contains 200,000,000 inhabitants,
of whom not one-half are adequately
supplied with metallic money. It would require,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
certainly, an addition of many milliards of francs
to the quantity of the present metallic circulation,
to put many of these countries in an equally
favourable position in this respect with France,
Belgium, Switzerland, Holland, and Great Britain.
We know, that only nations of industrious habits
are in want of a larger supply of gold and silver
because they alone carry on trade to any extent.
Abundance of production precedes and gives rise to
a demand for money. Wealth must exist in a
country before the sign of that wealth is required;
but, at the same time, it cannot be denied that the
circulation of the precious metals stimulates, to a
great degree, the creation of richness; it acts like
roads, canals, or other modes of transport, which,
by opening the means of reaching markets, extend
the radius of operations, and give additional
value to commodities. One half of Europe has
a trade of inconsiderable importance, and derives
but a small part of the benefit of the produce of
its own soil. It has neither industry nor credit.
In many countries now, gold and silver are replaced
by the use of paper-money, often discredited
in its own, and in all cases valueless out of its own
country.</p>

<p>Austria has just made, partly in London, and
partly in Frankfort, a loan of £3,500,000, intended
principally to restore the credit of her paper
money. This will be the first step towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
restoration of metallic money, which had disappeared
to such an extent, that the smaller notes were
often divided into four, to use for change. Prussia,
Poland, Russia, and Turkey, have experienced, in
different degrees, the like embarrassment. Before
these various markets are all superabundantly supplied
with gold and silver, the treasures of Siberia,
Australia, and the two Americas, may be diffused
for many years over the continent of Europe.</p>

<p>The scarcity of gold had restricted its use; in
France, for example, the smallest gold coin was
<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>20 francs. Since it has become more common, the
Mint have coined pieces of <a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>10 francs, which are
much liked, and are convenient for use. These
smaller coins appear likely to take the place of a
portion of our silver, which is needlessly cumbersome.
It is supposed that the use of Bank-notes of
<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>200 and 100 francs has economised the use of
several hundreds of millions of the precious metals.
The 10-franc pieces, when more generally used in
circulation, will take the place of, and drive out a
portion of silver coin. The demand for silver then
will diminish, whilst that for gold is increasing.
Silver will be used as change for gold&mdash;as gold is
for bank-notes. This is the case to such an extent
in England, where the silver circulation is small,
that the Mint in London, which coined £1,492,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
sterling in gold, in 1850, only coined £130,000 sterling
in silver in the same year, whilst, in the same
year, <a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>86,000,000 francs in silver were coined at the
Mint in Paris. It must not be forgotten that the
use of the precious metals is not confined to the
limits of Christian civilization. The Chinese import
Peruvian and Mexican dollars in exchange
for their silks and teas; they attract by their
trade the gold produced in the neighbouring
Islands, and in the Straits of Sunda. This industrious
nation has sent its contingent of labourers
and traders both to California and Australia.
A portion of Californian gold has already
gone to China, but Australia appears better situated
for the purpose of supplying the eastern regions
and the southern portions of Asia with the precious
metals. The Australian gold, however, sent there
will be as so much lost treasure; for whilst the
precious metals which are thrown into circulation
in Europe continue in use as coin for a long time,
that which is sent to China, or India, or Africa,
altogether disappears; it is not required for circulation,
but seems to be consumed.</p>

<p>Nothing appears more likely to restore the confidence
of those who have taken alarm at the
abundance of gold than the consideration of the
almost unlimited extent of its market. What people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
civilized or uncivilized, agricultural or manufacturing,
do not enter into competition for a supply!
What are the millions of francs extracted from the
Cordilleras when compared with the capital created
by the labour of the inhabitants of the whole
globe?</p>

<p>The combined washings of the Altai, California,
and Australia, during a quarter of a century, would
be required to produce a sum equal to the annual
revenue of England alone. This unexpected harvest
of the precious metals is but an addition to a
common fund of wealth; it cannot produce a deep
or a durable impression on the almost incalculable
mass of wealth already existing in the world.</p>

<p>After all, Europe herself does not preserve gold
and silver as relics. Money is used by wear and tear
to such an extent that it must from time to time be
recoined, and the consequent loss falls on the community
at large. The use of silver and gold plate, of
gold work and jewellery, is increasing every day, as a
distinguishing mark of the rise of the middle classes;
the manufacturers of France, England, and Switzerland
are at work for all the world. English statisticians
have estimated the loss, from use, disasters
at sea, and export without return of the precious
metals, in the United States and Europe, at more
than <a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>125,000,000 francs a-year. A more moderate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
estimate reduces this sum to <a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>75,000,000 francs. As
to articles of luxury, the sums of gold and silver employed
therein annually, have been estimated by Mr.
Jacob, at <a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>148,000,000 francs, without including the
consumption of the United States of America. Mr.
M’Culloch, who embraces the United States in his calculations,
puts the amount at <a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>150,000,000. France,
herself employing upwards of <a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>30,000,000 francs, it
may be admitted, without fear of exaggeration, that
the sum of <a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>125,000,000 of gold is used for domestic
purposes. Here, then, we have an annual consumption
of <a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>200,000,000 francs; the proportion borne
by gold in this absorption of the precious metals
is every day becoming more important. What
remains, at the present time, of the enormous masses
of the precious metals which Mexico and Peru
have poured forth during the last three centuries?
The amount of gold and silver now in the form
of circulation would scarcely equal the produce
of the mines during the last fifty years. The
30 milliards which America sent to Europe, from
the Spanish Conquest to the beginning of the
19th century, has almost entirely disappeared. It
would appear as if industry, in its contact with
gold and silver, must have volatilized it. France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
converted into coin a large amount of the precious
metals; but when coined, it did not remain
there. Exportation appears constantly to produce
the effect of banishing it from the country.
Thus, in twelve years, from 1840 to 1852, we have
imported <a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>123,012 kilogrammes of gold, and we
have exported <a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>71,217 kilogrammes; the difference
in favour of the import being <a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>51,795 kilogrammes,
equal to <a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>181,138,000 francs, showing an average
of <a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>15,000,000 francs per annum. Jewellery, goldsmith’s
work and gilding, employ, annually, in
France, quantities of gold exceeding that sum in
amount. The excess, then, is taken from the coinage,
which accounts for the ordinary premium on
gold in our market. The average would be considerably
reduced if we except the year 1851,
during which the import has exceeded the export
by <a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>34,503 kilogrammes; but the results of 1851
may be considered as exceptional. Already, the
greater part has disappeared; gold finds its way
from France to London. The Bank of France, whose
metallic reserve in 1851 included an amount of
<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>100,000,000 francs of gold, now does not hold above
<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>15,000,000 to 20,000,000. French gold coin, common
enough in Paris, is scarcely seen in the provinces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>From 1840 to 1852, French commerce imported
<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>10,175,312 kilogrammes of silver, and exported
<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>3,688,279 kilogrammes. The excess of import,
<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>6,487,033 kilogrammes, represents a sum of
1,303,893,633 francs, or 108,657,802 francs a year.
Admitting that <a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>15,000,000 are annually absorbed
in the demands for articles of luxury, and
<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>10,000,000 or 12,000,000 for wear, our monetary
reserve of silver would have increased at
least <a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>1,100,000,000 since 1840. This leaves a
large margin in the circulation of France for the
displacement of silver by gold coin. When the
import of gold shall have exceeded the export by
an amount equal annually to <a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>200,000,000 francs,
with this accumulated reserve of <a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>1,100,000,000 and
with an annual excess of <a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>80,000,000 to 90,000,000
francs over the import and consumption of silver, it
will require at least ten years to restore the equilibrium
between the two metals, to the state in
which it was in 1840.</p>

<p>No subject has given rise to more rash and speculative
opinions than that connected with the trade
in gold and silver. Amidst the great variety of conflicting
phenomena, statistics appear almost valueless;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
but so long as gold continues to bear a premium,
in spite of the apparent superabundance, and
notwithstanding its partial demonetization, it may
well be considered doubtful whether the relative
proportions, established by law between gold and
silver in so many countries, will be materially
affected for at least some years to come.</p>

<p>Various remedies have been proposed by alarmists,
to prevent the evils of the influx of Californian
and other gold. Some have desired that government
should limit the quantity of gold to be annually
coined. This expedient, in the event of a
depreciation in value, would be of little avail, for
the quantity imported and kept in the shape of bars,
would equally augment the general stock, and weigh
down the price. Others have thought of altering
the legal value, but this plan would be useless as
long as gold remained at a premium. If gold became
depreciated it would be injurious only until the fall
was ascertained, and considered durable; this once
determined, things would go on as before.</p>

<p>Then comes the question as to the demonetization
of gold; doubtless no point is of greater importance
for a standard of circulation than a fixed value. It is
a fact that in all those countries where a double standard
of gold and silver is established, one or other
has always obtained the ascendancy, and maintained
a premium, and has ceased to appear in the shape
of money; logically, it would appear quite enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
to regulate all prices by the value of one metal,
without exposing trade to the uncertainty of an
alteration in value of two. In the adoption of one
only, however, it is desirable to examine which of
the two has, over any given period of time, been
subject to the least variation. Before the discovery
of California, silver would certainly have had
little chance of being selected. Even now it appears
to me that the question has not so materially
changed as might at first sight be supposed.</p>

<p>It should be remembered also, that it is not so
easy for all countries who may have adopted the
double standard to exclude one from their monetary
code. The example of Holland has proved that
gold, having lost its character as legal money, will
no longer be used as a token. To demonetize gold
is to exclude it from the market. For a great
commercial country like Holland, living in the
greatest freedom, and carrying on its trade by
exchanging and carrying the products of all the
countries in the world, to exclude one of its
habitual means of exchange, may not be attended
with great risks. England, though little disposed
to imitate Holland at present, might perhaps do
so with less danger, from having the commerce
of the whole world in its hands. France,
unless under pressing necessity, could not demonetize
her gold without exposing herself to a
complete disturbance in all her relations, both at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
home and abroad. Our trade is tied up by a completely
protective system, without alluding to those
direct prohibitions which disgrace our customs’
tariffs; almost all the duties which affect articles of
primary consumption are, in short, disguised prohibitions.
In exchange for the products of our own
country, which we have to sell to the foreigner, we
can hardly purchase in return anything but raw
materials. Thus, bar and pig-iron, those articles
of primary importance, have been subjected to duties
at the rate of 100 per cent. on their value. In
those countries enjoying a legislation attentive to
the wants of trade, and where the custom-houses
are only for the objects of revenue, the imports and
the exports will show an even balance. In our
country, where we have been desirous of opposing
a barrier to the free course of exchange, goods
exported have always a preponderance in value
over those imported. In 1850, for example, the
imports represented a value of <a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>790,000,000 francs,
and the exports <a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>1,068,000,000 francs, showing a
difference of <a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>278,000,000. England and the United
States, together, receive of our products an excess
of <a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>236,000,000 above the exports we receive
from them; and as those countries with which we
trade cannot pay us in goods, they must make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
their return in gold and silver. This was the
reason of the import of <a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>220,000,000 francs in coin
in 1850, as shown in our official returns. So long
as the system of protection is the ruling policy of
France, so long will it be impossible to deprive gold
of its value as money; to attempt it would be to
withdraw from trade one of its most useful means
of exchange. It would check, if not stop, all intercourse
with those countries who can only pay
in gold, or who can only sell us those commodities
which we endeavour to exclude by our tariffs.
Gold flows naturally only to those countries where
it is marketable; and it is only so where it is in use
as coin as well as in commerce. A profit of half per
thousand is sufficient in the present day to turn the
current of the precious metals. This circumstance
ought not to be lost sight of in the consideration of
monetary legislation.</p>

<p>In fact, the change in the relative value of gold and
silver, which was so strongly anticipated, appears
anything but imminent; if any great change is now
taking place, it appears rather to be that of a simultaneous
depreciation in the value of both metals.
Deep thinking persons are not content with expressing
their fears; they are already providing themselves
with the means of averting the evils which
they anticipate. This is one of the causes which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
have raised the value of railroad stocks, and of
landed property; and this explains the comparative
abandonment, not of speculation, but of capital ordinarily
seeking investment in government stocks.
Alarm is felt at placing money on security, of which
both the capital and the interest may remain at a
fixed value; these may be the more sensibly affected,
if the value of the precious metals is altered;
whereas the shareholder of a railroad would have
a chance of having his income increased; and the
landed proprietors that of having their capital augmented
in the same proportion in which the value
of money would be depreciated.</p>

<p>In dwelling on these facts, I have no idea of setting
myself up as a prophet. I would confine myself
to the wish to indicate some of the symptoms of the
present position of these matters; the danger, if any
exists, is certainly not very near at hand. We have
already seen the use of bank notes in France increased
to an extent which, owing to the stability
of their value, has largely taken the place of specie. It
is but reasonable to suppose, that the present abundance
of gold and silver will make no greater disturbance
within a short time, than has the great
increase of paper money.</p>

<p>The influx of the precious metals has been, in a
certain sense, a providential occurrence during the
revolutionary state of Europe. Credit had either
disappeared, or had at least become stagnant. Everywhere,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
amidst the tempest of the times, both past
and prospective, business had been suspended, or
carried on only for ready money. Affairs had assumed
an aspect of a primitive state of exchange.
An increase of metallic circulation might again
restore confidence, and calm agitation. The average
excess of money imported over that exported,
which, before 1848, was not above <a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>80,000,000 to
100,000,000 francs, amounted in 1848 and 1849 to
nearly <a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>300,000,000 francs for each year. Specie in
these times supplied the wants of trade, and maintained
prices; but, in more easy times, when used
not alone, but concurrently with paper money and
bills of exchange, for the purposes of circulation,
gold and silver would naturally be in use in proportion
to the movements of trade. The reason
why <a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>600,000,000 of francs in coin now encumbers
the vaults of the Bank of France, is, because capital
is only employed in the stock markets, and that
the restoration of trade on a large scale is still confined
to a sort of anticipation; but let the industry
of the country experience a complete restoration of
confidence in the future, and we shall soon see the
metallic reserve of the bank diminish; and, as a
natural consequence, our market will attract an
import of the precious metals from abroad. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
short, gold and silver will then be wanted; the
state of trade will improve, and we shall have to
seek for an increased supply.</p>

<p>Let us not then either despair or be too confident;
the world is not entering on an Eldorado, nor is it
on the eve of a state of ruin. Those who consider
gold and silver as positive wealth, who confound
an abundant supply of the precious metals with an
abundance of capital, and who affirm that the gold
imported from California must lower the rate of
interest, should remember that the rate of interest
is determined by the state of confidence, as well
as by the general rule of the supply and demand
for loanable capital, and that confidence depends
upon the good order existing throughout the civilized
world. California itself shows the delusion
of such an idea&mdash;for there, where gold is strewing
the land, interest has risen as high as from
eight to ten per cent. per month. Those on the
contrary, who, at the idea of the galleons seeking
freights in the western continent, dream only of ruin
and catastrophes&mdash;who anticipate that the day will
arrive that the Bank of France will pay persons to
take away her gold&mdash;should not forget that she sells
it now without difficulty even at a small premium,
and that this increased trade in gold has not
hitherto ruined anybody.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
